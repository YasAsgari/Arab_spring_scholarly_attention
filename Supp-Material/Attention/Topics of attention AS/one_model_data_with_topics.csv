"To govern, or not to govern? Opportunity and post-coup military behaviour in Egypt 2011–2014",2019,"This article examines Egyptian military behaviour in 2011 and 2013 to address the question of why officers remain in power following some successful coups, and allow for a transition to civilian rule after others. My evidence suggests that in post-1970 cases where international factors fail to exert sufficient pressure, outcome variation is influenced by levels of corporate opportunity, defined here as the ease with which the army can use control of the state to expand its corporate interests. Drawing on the existing literature, I posit consensus against military rule, high popular support for democracy, strong civil society, the presence of a strong opposition party, and low levels of cohesion among officers as factors which constrain opportunity. Prior research suggests that when the level of opportunity is high, controlling the state becomes a high-risk/low-reward endeavour, making it likely that officers will allow for a transition to civilian rule. My study contributes to the existing scholarship by using original data gathered through interviews with Egyptian officers, as well as other experts on the Egyptian military, to argue that low consensus against military rule, low support for democracy, and high organizational cohesion are jointly sufficient to produce governing intervention.

Friends will be friends? External–domestic interactions in EU-Tunisia and EU-Morocco security cooperation after the uprisings,2019,"The article moves beyond the debate about the continuity and change in EU policy-making towards post-uprisings North Africa to explain the way in which the relationship evolved in the case of functional areas and notably security cooperation. Specifically, this article argues that persistence in the EU’s approach did not necessarily entail continuity in EU-Tunisia and EU-Morocco interactions on security. Rather, there have been changes in the continuity and continuity in the changes that took place. It is often assumed that the relationship is unidirectional and that target countries can simply choose either acquiescence or resistance. The post-uprising reality shows that domestic events in Tunisia and Morocco had an impact on how they approached the EU and how, in turn, the EU reacted to them. There is therefore what can be called a feedback loop that makes relationships more complex and ‘individualised’ than previously assumed. ","Friends will be friends?

Egypt is not for sale! Harnessing nationalism for alliance building in Egypt’s Tiran and Sanafir island protests,2019,"Adopting a discourse-theoretical perspective on contentious politics in Egypt, this article investigates how in early 2016 the transfer of the archipelago of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia became a catalyst for oppositional subject formation and the emergence of an unlikely protest coalition. Drawing on a combination of protest event analysis and discourse analysis, it explores how the land swap provided the opposition with an opportunity to challenge the state’s nationalist prestige, and produced relations that favoured cross-movement mobilisation. The so-called ‘Popular Campaign to Protect the Land’ brought together leftists, liberals and nationalists, and thus enabled the articulation of broader socio-political demands in an otherwise closed context. The case study illustrates how dissonance between the discourse and practices of nationalist regimes can trigger cross-ideological collaboration. It furthermore shows how the emergence, as well as the trajectory and goals of such alliances, are shaped by interaction with the state. ","Egypt is not for sale!

Gaining legitimacy in post-qaddafi libya: Analysing attempts of the muslim brotherhood,2019,"The Libyan Muslim Brotherhood needed to manoeuvre underground for several decades, just as most opposition groups in Libya had to—because of the repression from the Qaddafi regime. In 2012, however, the political wing of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB), the Justice and Construction Party (JCP, sometimes also called the Justice and Development Party) participated in popular elections just shortly after its inception. Seven years later, one can unanimously say that the movement was not able to take power in the country. This paper will analyse the LMB in post-revolutionary Libya by concentrating on the attempts of establishing legitimacy in the political sphere—while continuously being informed by historical influences. Methodologically, the paper examines primary sources, key academic texts but also factors in interview data from semi-structured interviews. Overall, the paper addresses the puzzle of why Libya as a predominantly Sunni, conservative country did not translate into a conservative Sunni movement like the LMB faring well, with that, derailing the impression that the whole region was “going Islamist” after the so-called Arab Spring. The LMB today is still influenced by the historical treatment it received under Qaddafi, which lead it to base itself mostly in exile, hence it struggled to entrench itself in the country. The LMB was pointed towards their opponents’ fearmongering of an alleged Islamist takeover, mostly without addressing self-inflicted wounds, such as their inability to unite or to convince major parts of the population of their political programme.

Blue blood or true blood: Why are levels of intrastate armed conflict so low in Middle Eastern monarchies?,2019,"In the aftermath of the Arab uprisings, the difference between monarchies and republics appears more profound than ever. Aside from Bahrain, all of the Middle Eastern monarchies avoided major anti-governmental protests, and no armed conflict has occurred in any of them since 1979. Inspired by Middle Eastern case studies, this article argues that traditional legitimacy contributes to peace in Middle Eastern monarchies. The article explores the argument with time-series cross-sectional data covering 19 Middle Eastern countries from 1947 (or independence) to 2009. Traditional legitimacy is not measured directly but assumed to be embedded in the monarchical regime type, and the results show that alternative covariates are unable to fully explain the monarchical peace. Moreover, the study finds that horizontal discrimination increases the risk of intrastate conflict in authoritarian republics but that discrimination has no effect in monarchies. Future conflict studies should therefore consider legitimacy connected to authoritarian regime types.

Perception of ESG criteria by mainstream investors: evidence from Tunisia,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the perception of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria by mainstream investors in an emerging financial market, that of Tunisia, country at the origin of the Arab Spring. Design/methodology/approach: A series of focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with financial professionals. Findings: Despite efforts by the Tunisian state to promote CSR and ESG criteria since the outbreak of the revolution of January 14th, 2011, the results show that these criteria are fairly well known by our interlocutors. As part of an investment allocation decision, the ESG criteria are considered as secondary to financial ones. The three criteria are classified as follows according to their usefulness in the investment choices of financial professionals: corporate governance, social and environmental. Research limitations/implications: In addition to the subjective nature of the data collected, this research is limited to the input of only financial professionals. It does not inform us about ESG indicators that may influence the investment decisions of financial professionals, and thus this issue deserves further reflection. Originality/value: This exploratory study sheds light on a little-explored topic in Tunisia, country at the origin of the Arab Spring. It contributes to the existing literature in the areas of investor behavior toward ESG criteria and adds to the limited literature in the area of emerging countries.

"Vulnerability, resistance and sexuality in revolutionary Egypt",2019,"This paper examines the interconnections between public sexual violence, female shame and public feminism in modern Egypt, using Judith Butler's Vulnerability and Resistance theory. It connects aspects of public sexual violence against women generally and politicized sexual violence in 21st-century Egypt in particular, arguing that successive political regimes in Egypt produce and maintain a spatial culture of vulnerability and inferiorization as a political tool of silencing and oppressing women and opposition premised upon media-oriented female shame ideas. These shame ideas relate and condemn female sexuality and public participation, establishing the public space as militarized, dangerous and exclusive. This paper attempts to reflect on the successes and failures of public feminism in Egypt in addressing such politicized culture of female vulnerability and isolation in public spaces, with a particular focus on fighting politicized forms of sexual violence directed against women in post-2011 revolutionary Egypt. It argues further that sexual violence against women and the repression of public feminism in Egypt are parts of the failure of the processes of democratic transition and state formation; the survival of socio-economic and cultural hierarchy and vulnerability in modern Egypt. The paper maintains that Egyptian women's remarkable and solid public activism during and after 2011-revolution shows them as able to invade the exclusive public spaces and hence are able to create new spaces of female resistance and new forms of public mobilization in the country.

Understanding Russia’s return to the Middle East,2019,"Over recent years, there has been a significant resurgence of Russian power and influence in the Middle East, which has been evident in the diplomatic and military intervention into Syria. This article identifies the principal factors behind Russia’s return to the region. First, there are domestic political influences with the coincidence of the uprisings in the Middle East, the so-called ‘Arab Spring,’ with large-scale domestic opposition protests within Russia during the elections in 2011–2012. Second, there is the role of ideas, most notably the growing anti-Westernism in Putin’s third presidential term, along with Russia’s own struggle against Islamist terrorism. These ideational factors contributed to Russia’s resolve to support the Assad government against both Western intervention and its domestic Islamist opposition. Third, Russia has benefited from a pragmatic and flexible approach in its engagement with the region. Moscow seeks to ensure that it is a critical actor for all the various states and political movements in the Middle East.

The Role of Regional Media in Shaping Political Awareness of Youth: Evidence from Egypt,2019,"This is an exploratory study that aims to answer the question of whether and to what extent regional media are influential in shaping political awareness and its role in influencing public opinion, especially that of young people. We examined regional media in Egypt, more precisely in the Suez Canal Region.

The results reveal that regional media have the potential to contribute effectively in raising youths' political awareness of the public policy-making process. The recommendations specified are the elimination of red tape, governmental bureaucracy, and centralization in the management of regional radio and television is required; also necessary are financial independence and the restructuring of the organizational hierarchy of all state-run regional media.

Regional maritime security in the eastern Mediterranean: Expectations and reality,2019,"Recent developments in the eastern Mediterranean, such as significant gas finds; disagreements over the demarcation of maritime boundaries; large-scale violence and political instability following the Arab Spring; mass migration via sea routes; Great Power dynamics in the region; and environmental hazards, make the political entities along the shores of the eastern Mediterranean part of a regional security complex and create strong incentives for regional coordination on maritime security.

Yet, the political entities in the region rely mainly on unilateral actions, or limited quasi-alliances in response to these challenges. The article shows the puzzling gap between the theoretical expectation and practical outcome in the region and explains why regional cooperation in the maritime domain fails to occur. It argues that cooperation on a regional scale fails to take place due to three complementing reasons: 1) lack of shared ideational features like cultural traits, set of values and regime type; 2) enduring rivalries between political entities in the region (Israel-Palestine; Turkey-Greece-Cyprus) coupled with internal strife within other regional political entities (Libya; Syria); and unequal political standing and lack of sovereignty of some of the political entities in the region (Northern Cyprus; the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza Strip).

The comparative exam of the different North African Ombudsmen will point out how the institution was able to survive only in states where a transition to democracy was truly in place.

Forest governance and the Arab spring: A case study of state forests in Tunisia,2019,"Since the end of the 19th century, there have been three main periods of forest management evolution in Tunisia: (i)the French colonial period (1881–1956), characterized by a coercive and authoritarian management system, (ii)the postcolonial period (1956–2011), during which forest bureaucracy maintained and promoted this coercive and police management, and (iii)the period following the revolution of 2011, marked with policy reforms pushing more sustainable forest management. The paper analyzes the pre-revolution performance of forest administration and the reform discourses of post-revolution forest policy programs. From a methodological perspective, the three-layer model is applied to evaluate the performance of state forest institutions comprehensively before the revolution and then to illustrate the assumed impact of the new policy programs on this performance with two new forest policy programs serving as case studies. Data used in this paper were collected between 2016 and 2018 through field observations, public and non-public documents analysis and expert interviews. The results indicate that post-revolution forest policy programs fail to foster an efficient implementation of their objectives and the improvement of the performance of forest administration as well. Two major reasons can be put forward to explain this failure. First, the lack of comprehensiveness and coherence of the objectives. Second, the gap between these objectives and the time needed for an efficient implementation. To conclude, this study highlights the need to pay more attention to particular causative factors in the design and implementation of post-revolution ‘strong´ policies in the forest domain.

Mobilization of Moroccan women: The dialectics of conflict and empowerment,2019,"This article draws on the experience gained and the lessons learned during and after the Arab Spring protest movements that called for economic, social, and political change. It raises the issue of the role Moroccan women played in these movements. In attempting to address this issue, the article relies essentially on bibliographical information and data derived from studies and writings that dealt with the feminist struggle in Morocco as a whole. It suffers from the lack of openness to a sociological approach or a political viewpoint in Arab and foreign scientific productions concerned with the struggles of women in Arab or Maghreb countries. In parallel, the study uses ethnographic research discerningly, since accurate and sufficient information available on the local protest movements has not received the necessary follow-up and definition. The article first monitors the shift in the dynamics of women's protests and focuses on the persistent manifestations within them; it also considers the motives that contribute to the growth of this dynamic while stressing the extent of women's participation in the February 20 Movement and in rural areas. It then identifies the results and extensions of this participation in relation to the requirements of empowerment. Finally, it discusses the problem of development and democracy that prevent women from achieving the desired change in the short term.

"Constructive Journalism in Arab Transitional Democracies: Perceptions, Attitudes and Performance",2019,"In the Arab region, unexpected political changes have influenced the media scene; political and commercial pressures exercised over media entities have affected their credibility and created a crisis of trust. This study focuses on Egypt and Tunisia as the first two Arab countries who experienced political uprisings in 2010/2011, and endured 30-year presidencies. It examines the role that constructive journalism can have during transitional periods given the critical role of media in transitional countries, highlights the possible challenges within the given political, economic context and changes in the media landscapes, and proposes a model of implementation. A total of 21 Egyptian and Tunisian journalists were interviewed for this study. Among the main identified roles of constructive journalism during transitional periods are: regaining audience trust and engagement, fighting terrorism, serving the public interest and reviving the economy of the mainstream media. Interviewees pointed to political power structures, private ownership and the possible negative connotations of the term constructive as the main challenges. An integrated strategy between the mainstream media and social media platforms based on the concept of “constructive-interactive” was proposed by the interviewees as the optimum model to pave the way for a reconciliation between media entities and their audiences.

Local Solidarities: How the Arab Spring Protests Started,2019,"Coming as a surprise to most observers and following the self-immolation of a street vendor in a remote town of central Tunisia, the Jasmine Revolution of 2010–2011, the first uprising of the Arab Spring, has often been seen as a success story for digital communication through widespread use of social media. We suggest that this applied to the later phase of the protests in Tunisia but not to the initial phase, which occurred in local areas in impoverished and marginalized regions with highly limited access to the Internet. The initial phase lasted a full 10 days before the protests reached major cities where social media operated. Building on Tilly's concept of trust network, we offer the concept of local solidarities as key to the beginning of the Arab Spring uprisings and as encompassing spatial proximity, shared marginalized status, and kinship, all of which combined to serve as a basis for trust and collective action.

The Consequences of Some Angry Re-Tweets: Another Medium is the Message,2019,"Most research on the Gulf states focuses on oil and its impact on state power. The literature on rentier theory almost unanimously agrees that oil rents buy off citizens and lead to socio-political stagnation. Massive protests and government attempts to address citizen demands in Kuwait between 2011 and 2013 call into question that narrative. Since those protests, the Kuwaiti government has taken steps to increase its representation of public officials and accessibility in the public sphere, including by expanding the government's presence on Instagram. How have Kuwaiti citizens voiced their opinions to government accounts? And how has the government responded to online criticism? This essay looks at the pattern of interactions between the state and Kuwaiti citizens on Twitter and Instagram using a content analysis of government accounts. The findings raise questions about the validity of the payoff thesis and understandings of consent and acquiescence.

Ambition and consequences the future of iran's involvement in latin america after the nuclear agreement of 2015,2019,"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was reached in 2015 after years of involved talks between world powers (the United States of America, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Germany) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Negotiations between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council (plus Germany) began in 2006, but suffered many setbacks, causing a delay in finalizing the agreement. One major obstacle involved several of the negotiating countries imposing numerous sanctions against Iran, causing public resentment and economic hardships to the Iranian people. For the United States of America (USA) involvement in such talks was unique, as the two countries had not negotiated directly for more than three decades. Since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution the UN and USA imposed (and later expanded) trade embargoes, asset freezing, and economic sanctions on Iran due to its ""terrorist activities"". This article will examine the effect of the Iranian Nuclear Agreement on the future of Iran's ambition of expansion in Latin America by focusing on what little influence the Nuclear Deal had on Iran's hegemonic and hostile behavior in its own region, and using it to measure how it would decide to expand into Latin America. This paper explores the Islamic Republic of Iran's involvement in Latin America before the JCPOA was reached in 2015, highlighting the essence of Iranian ambition directed at creating a safe haven for its covert activities in the backyard of its perceived historical enemy: the United States of America. The presence of Iran and its presumed hidden agenda and strategies in Latin America are analyzed here in an attempt predict Iran's future plans in Latin America, especially when the world is expecting it to make progress and abandon its so-called ""terrorist activities"". This paper highlights the four factors that play an important role in the long-established aspirations of the Iranian government to expand its revolution beyond its borders in order to establish a global Islamic entity. This would eventually create a new world order where Iran is a key player in world politics, and the USA and Europe have limited influence. These four points can be categorized as the contributing factors that will shape and determine Iran's future in Latin America. These four factors are: Iran’s constitutional revolutionary principles, Iran's hegemonic activities in the Middle East, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and their competition over expanding Latin American relations, and the effect of the nuclear agreement on modifying Iran’s behavior towards the US and the rest of the world. This paper attempts to answer this question: how effective was the Nuclear Deal in curbing Iran's ambitious plan of expanding its influence in Latin America? By answering this question, this paper offers new insights into Iranian– Latin American relations that have been flourishing over the past decade but have garnered little attention in the media, academia, or among decision makers in the Persian/Arab Gulf region and the West. The author concludes that reaching and implementing the Nuclear Deal has done little to stop Iran from pursuing destabilizing activities beyond its borders, specifically through political, intelligence, and military interference in the Persian/Arab Gulf region and other Arab countries-particularly Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Therefore, Tehran sees expansion in Latin America as inevitable, as Iranian interest in the region increases in an effort to protect the global advancement of its protege Hezbollah.

How do protest movements deal with these authoritarian measures in return? Based on qualitative fieldwork with 70 young people in Egypt from April until November 2015, I demonstrate that regimes which face major contentious events and transition back to authoritarian rule, utilize two main strategies for fragmenting protest movements: repression and cooptation. The main literature on protest movements contends that regimes respond to protest movements through a combination of repression and concession to offset movement gains and eliminate their motivations for further protests. More concessions are believed to be effective in democratic regimes, while more repression is effective in authoritarian regimes. However, the results of this fieldwork demonstrate the importance of repression in addition to cooptation in authoritarian regimes, which is largely ignored in the literature on protest movements. Cooptation is an instrumental tactic for the regime in two manners: first it creates internal struggles within the movements themselves, which adds to their fragmentation. Second, it facilitates a regime’s repression against protest movement actors. This creates more fragmentation in addition to deterrence to the development of new protest movements and protest activities.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta of Egypt using machine learning and satellite big data: implications for sustainable development,2019,"The Nile Delta of Egypt is increasingly facing sustainability threats, due to a combination of nature- and human-induced changes in land cover and land use. In this paper, an analysis of big time series data from remotely sensed satellite images and the random forests classifier was undertaken to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta between 2007 and 2017. Out of thirteen variables, five spectral indices were chosen to build 500 decision trees, with a resulting overall accuracy average of 91.9 ± 1.5%. The results revealed that the urban extent in the Nile Delta has increased, between 2007 and 2017, by 592.4 km2 (1.92%). Particularly, the results indicated that the years 2011 and 2012, which coincided the 2011 political uprising in Egypt, so-called the Arab Spring, were associated with significant land-use changes in the Nile Delta, both in rate and scale. As a result, the cropland area in the region decreased between 2010 and 2011 by 1.63% (502.21 km2). Moreover, the results showed that during the period 2012–2017, the mean annual urbanization rate in the region stood at 60 km2/year. In contrast, croplands decreased during the same period at an average annual rate of 2 km2/year. At the governorates’ level, the results suggested that top agricultural producing governorates in the Nile Delta, such as Elmonoufia, Elkalubia, Elbouhyra, and Elghrbia, witnessed the highest rates of decrease in cropland areas during the period 2012–2017. Over the same period, urban areas increased the most in Elkalubia, Domiate, and Elmonoufia by 1.98%, 1.72%, and 1.34%, respectively.

Yet few studies have examined the effects of exposure to protests on population well-being even though such exposure may have profound and lasting effects, especially if experienced at critical stages of development over the life course. The aim of our study is to estimate the effects of exposure to political protests on the human capital accumulation and well-being of youth during the tumultuous political transition experienced in Egypt from 2011 to 2014. For a nationally representative panel of youth captured in the 2009 and 2013/2014 waves of the Survey of Young People in Egypt (SYPE), we exploit exogenous geospatial variation in the occurrence of political protests from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project to estimate individual-level changes in social trust, uncertainty, education, and health outcomes for youth exposed to protests. In our panel, 31.1% of the sample lived in districts where riots or protests occurred. Exposure to protests increased overall perceptions of uncertainty about the future. Young men ever exposed to protests were slightly more likely to report good overall health, but experienced sizable worsening in mental health compared to young women ever exposed. Differences by own and family participation in protest events were found for perceptions of uncertainty and mental health. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring and other mass protest movements around the globe, these findings highlight the importance of examining the population-level impacts of different forms of political conflict, particularly as substantial numbers of youth in Middle East and North Africa and elsewhere progress to adulthood under conditions of political instability.

"An ‘alternative framework for development:’ state-citizen relations, urban revitalization, and Downtown Cairo’s passageways",2019,"In the years since the ‘January 25th Revolution’ of 2011, Egypt has fallen on hard times, wracked by ongoing state instability and the unraveling of its economy. Against the backdrop of this political and economic turmoil, Cairo has emerged as an object of renewed interest and attention. The resulting sociospatial interventions have ranged from restoration projects targeting Cairo’s numerous architectural legacies to mapping and documentation initiatives intended to generate reliable urban data. This article queries the reconstitution of the urban landscape via an exploration of the work of the Cairo Lab for Urban Studies, Training and Environmental Research (CLUSTER), an independent urban research group established after January 25th. I begin by locating the organization’s work in the broader context of sociospatial transformations in Downtown Cairo, a neighborhood that has long played an important role in the urban and national landscapes and which is currently undergoing rapid change. I then unpack the group’s activities in the district–especially those pertaining to the neighborhood’s so-called passageways–and the political ideologies underpinning them. I conclude by suggesting that CLUSTER's interventions are vulnerable to appropriation by other actors working in the area.

Decentralisation in Morocco: a solution to the ‘Arab Spring’?,2019,"After 2011, several Arab states initiated decentralisation reforms to address the demonstrators’ demands for more participative governance and more efficient public services. Taking Morocco's new decentralisation reform as a case in point, this article assesses the requirements for, and impediments to, progress. It discovers that the reform articulates important democratic principles and formally opens new spaces of action that may facilitate more efficient and participative governance. However, historical legacies of centralised control, few opportunities for participation, low institutional capacities and weak accountability, and also unclear regulations within the reform, are still hindering effective decentralisation. The potentially positive impact of current reforms on political liberalisation is thus uncertain. Recent uprisings in the Rif region are symptomatic of the neglect of regional inequalities and grievances, and of related dissatisfaction. They also illustrate that increased regional autonomy can only alleviate the structural problems in the longer term and when thoroughly implemented.

The discursive construction of ‘Tunisianité’ (2011–2017),2019,"This study investigates the discursive construction of the idea of tunisianité in a sample of 41 articles published in the national press in the wake of the Arab Spring. Using analytical categories developed within the discourse-historical approach, the analysis indicates three general, strongly secularist, representations of tunisianité. One of these, which can be called essentialist, claims an unmistakable ethnolinguistic connection to a glorified pre-Arabo-Islamic classicism which goes back to the foundation of Carthage (814–146 BC). A second and a more dominant (avowedly consensual) one construes tunisianité in assimilationist terms, that is, Tunisia as a ‘melting pot’ lumping different Eastern and Western ethnolinguistic and cultural traditions. A third emerging, but a marginalized trend in the data, grounds tunisianité within the Enlightenment/Revolutionary ideals of Democracy, Dignity and Freedom and warns against its possible disintegration because of its vulnerability to the upheavals of terrorism, corporatism, populism and socioeconomic insecurity. While the third representation is laudable from the perspective of the Revolutionary demands, the dominant nationalist identity discourse remains backward-looking, reactionary and strongly preoccupied with a perceived political invasion by the Islamist-Arabist Other. It is argued that the dominant model of identity politics and the political economy associated with it are incompatible with Tunisians’ aspirations for socioeconomic development and social justice.

"The financial and market consequences of environmental, social and governance ratings: The implications of recent political volatility in Egypt",2019,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the combined impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings on the market and financial performance of Egyptian companies during the period from 2007 to 2016 and, thereby, determines the influence of the recent political revolutions –that broke out in the MENA region in early 2011 – on the association between ESG practices and corporate performance. Design/methodology/approach: The present work uses data from the S&P/EGX ESG index, which is the first of its kind in the MENA region. The ESG index is designed to increase the profile of companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange and is expected to boost the level and quality of ESG practices in the Egyptian context. The sample includes the 100 most active Egyptian companies in the Egyptian Stock Exchange as measured by the EGX 100 index in the financial year that ended in 2016. The sample begins in 2007, concurrent with the start of the ESG index, and ends in 2016. The period from 2007 to 2010 represents the pre-revolution period, and the period from 2012 to 2016 is the post-revolution period. Findings: Firms with high ESG ratings are found to enjoy a better financial and market performance. The authors found some evidence that the influence of ESG ratings on financial performance is more obvious after the revolutions than before the revolutions. Practical implications: This study provides insights regarding the impact of political events on the market in the Middle East region. Despite its increasing economic and political importance, this region still suffers from inadequate attention in the literature. The present work investigates the variances that evolved out of the events that started in early 2011 and the implications of these events on the market. The results of this study have implications for regulators and investors in the Egyptian stock market. The authors believe that the relatively new S&P/EGX ESG index provides a way to enhance ESG ratings in Egypt. Social implications: The results of the present study provide insights for policymakers regarding the usefulness of the sustainability indices. Originality/value: The present results contribute to the growing literature on the economic consequences of ESG ratings, especially in relation to a context characterized by intense political/revolutionary changes. In particular, this study contributes to the few works that have addressed the economic implications of ESG ratings in emerging markets.

Why on Earth Would Some People Reject Democracy? An Autoethnographic Reflection on Education and Democracy in Egypt,2019,"In 2013, thousands of Egyptians protested in the streets of Cairo in an effort to overthrow the country’s first democratically elected president only 1 year after he took office.

However, using an autoethnographic method, I argue that any analysis of this phenomenon that does not include curriculum and education is inadequate. This autoethnographic essay argues that Egypt’s curriculum and its schooling system are fundamental factors that contributed to this phenomenon. Fundamentally, this paper discusses the theoretical and practical relationship between curriculum and democracy from an autoethnographic perspective by assessing the nature of this relationship both in democratic societies and in Egypt.

Hiding in plain sight: the Coptic Museum in the Egyptian cultural landscape,2019,"Museums have long been important tools of nation building and of helping nations deal with their increasing diversity. The Arab Spring of 2011 brought massive social upheaval and change to the Middle East. Egypt experienced particularly dramatic changes. Long-standing fissures around who qualifies as an Egyptian, which groups dominate in this secular or religious nation, and what it means to be an Egyptian today came to the fore. How did different groups fare within this negotiation and what role did cultural institutions play? We explore these struggles through the lens of the Coptic Museum and the experiences of the Coptic community. We argue that the Museum historicises Copticism, or depicts it as an historical, bounded period in Egyptian history. It also embraces a historical narrative that sees Copts as the direct descendants of the Pharaohs, and therefore the original Egyptians, although some later converted to Islam. By so doing, the Museum positions the community centrally but unchallengingly within the ever-changing ‘master’ national narrative, whether in its more religious or secular form. By telling this particular story, the community saves itself and its materials, but it also constructs and perpetuates its paradoxically central, but marginal position in the nation.

In this article, we ask why these organizations have been unable to present a coherent and unified TJ agenda. We show how a sequence of mechanisms (transnational brokerage, vertical coordination, and patronage relations) have led to fragmentation in the pursuit of justice. The analysis is divided into two sections. First, we discuss the onset of patronage relations made possible by brokered alliances and vertical coordination. Fuelled by differing conceptions of justice and confidence that the regime would quickly fall, organizations proliferated and fragmented. Second, we show how the entrenchment of patronage relations has largely precluded horizontal coordination, even as groups shifted strategy in the wake of changing conditions in Syria. We then argue that collaborative efforts among diaspora groups have largely failed to overcome the rigid patronage relations established early in the mobilization phase.

Asking if, how, and to what effect the EU and its Mediterranean partners have negotiated issues related to democracy promotion, it analyses official documents issued on the occasion of their respective association council meetings in 2000-2010. It shows that partners have indeed addressed these issues since the early 2000s, however, without engaging in substantive exchanges. Most of the time, conflicts have been neither directly addressed nor resolved. Where there are traces of actual negotiations leading to an agreement, these are clearly based on a logic of bargaining rather than arguing. These findings challenge the picture of harmony and cooperation between the EU and Morocco. Furthermore, they point to the low quality of these exchanges which reinforces the dilemma of international democracy promotion in cooperation with authoritarian regimes.

The impact of the Arab Spring on democracy and development in the MENA region,2019,"In evaluating the consequences of the Arab Spring 8 years later, this paper not only focuses on the short-term consequences of the uprisings that swept through a number of countries in the Middle East and North African region but also analyzes the long-term prospects for democratization and development in the MENA region. The impact of the Arab Spring, despite its promises and the expectations of the rest of the world, has been dismal. While only Tunisia made a successful transition to a democratic polity with a constitution guaranteeing the basic rights of the people, the rest of the Arab Spring countries remain in the grip of the authoritarian rule, and countries such as Syria, Libya, and Yemen have been degenerated into bloody civil wars with dwindling hope of peace and freedom. On economic front, the growth has been tardy, showing little difference with countries that were unaffected by the Arab Spring. Yet, the paper concludes, echoing historian Eric Hobsbawm's view, that revolutionary outcomes need not be judged as failure too quickly as they are likely to be partial success in the long term. The impact may be observed in the area of social opening, newer class alliances, and the emergence of a less rapacious, reformed, hybrid authoritarianism.

The flexible governance of water in Cairo's informal areas,2019,"This article explores the relationship between informality and water infrastructure in informal areas in Egypt. I apply three concepts drawn from the wider literatures on state power and governance: Topological power, flexible governing, and the ""statization"" of urban space. I find that infrastructure has functioned as one of the main instruments through which the state is produced or ""effected"" in the daily lives of residents. Due to this, examining the governance of water infrastructure in informal areas exposes the Egyptian state's ""flexibility"" and the uneven nature of its power. I argue that this flexibility is a result of the ad hoc nature of power in governance and the uneven quality of the state's authority and reach. This flexibility creates a waterscape constituted by overlapping infrastructures, practices, and actors, making traditional binaries such as public-private and formal-informal meaningless. However, I find that in Egypt's post-Arab-Spring era, the state has been seeking ways to effect its presence more strongly within informal areas, and one of the ways in which it has been doing so is by incorporating ""informal"" users into the ""formal"" public water supply and allowing/forcing them to pay for water. I argue that this accommodation of informality is a way to increase the statization of informal areas, while also charging them for water usage. In this way, I find that the state's flexibility allows it to benefit from informality without having to actually ""formalise"" the neighbourhoods themselves or address the underlying causes of why they are labelled as informal.

Transnational securitisation of identity: Distinctions between securitisation and ‘othering’ of shias in Bahrain and Pakistan,2019,"This paper aims to shed light on the phenomenon of transnational securitisation of identity and how it influences state-level securitisation and communal ‘othering’. We propose a more nuanced understanding of state-societal relations by viewing ‘othering’ as a by-product of various types of securitisation of identities, as opposed to the normative assumption within existing scholarship that applies these concepts interchangeably. This provides a more discernible lens through which certain cultural processes of discrimination are articulated, manifest and evaluated. The basis for our analysis is presented by comparing the persecution levelled against Shia communities within Bahrain and Pakistan, respectively. In the case of Bahrain, transnational securitisation amplifies pre-existing state securitisation, with external agents – in this context, Saudi Arabia – harnessing the hard power tactic of military intervention, as witnessed during the 2011 uprisings. Whereas in the case of Pakistan, transnational securitisation is performed by utilising soft power mechanisms, namely the legacy of petro-dollar wealth that has been used as a form of extremist proselytisation. The proliferation of jihadist non-state actors that pose an existential threat to Shia communities in Pakistan in recent years is a testament to this. In this way, the process bypasses state institutions to induce bottom-up, communal ‘othering’.

Notably, it identifies a generational division between those activists that started to engage in the late 2000s or during and after the 2011 ouster of Ben Ali and those who were already active before.

The differing ideologies, objectives and approaches to activism within Bahrain’s Shiʿi opposition are investigated through an analysis of each group’s framing of themes including religion, violence, nationalism and sectarianism. The first empirical study of social media image activism in post-Arab Spring Bahrain, this article reveals the increasing fragmentation of the Shiʿi opposition following the 2011 uprising, and makes a valuable contribution to the broader debate surrounding the changing nature of activism in an increasingly visual digital age.

The Jihad post-Arab Spring: Contextualising Islamic radicalism in Egypt and Tunisia,2019,"This article examines the rise in jihadi activity within North Africa in recent years and aims to answer two fundamental questions: first, how have local and foreign jihadi groups capitalised on the unique domestic contexts in Tunisia and Egypt in the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolutions to advance their insurgencies? Next, what are the key factors conducive to extremism in both countries that have facilitated this? This study highlights the importance of contending with extremism with respect to the differentiated socio-historical, political and economic circumstances of each country. From a broader perspective, several trends common in the rise of extremism in both countries are identified. First, there is a tendency of extremism to consolidate in proportion to the amount of institutional void. Next, conditions of poverty often supply futile ground for the entrenchment of terrorism; in particular, the study highlights on how jihadi groups have made a concerted effort to damage the economic interests of each country. Finally, the presence of historical grievances provides a conducive environment for extremism. In light of the threat of cell dispersion following the recent defeats faced by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, an understanding of jihadi operations in North Africa becomes increasingly crucial.

"The importance of the Saudi-UAE alliance: notes on military intervention, aid and investment",2019,"This contribution focuses on the shifts in the characteristics and forms of intervention by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the Middle East and North Africa post the Arab Uprisings of 2011–2012. Although less commented upon, increasing military intervention by the two states has been accompanied by ‘aid intervention’, whereby financial assistance is utilised to secure foreign policy objectives. While scholarly work on intervention typically focuses on Western intervention and, to a lesser extent, the BRICS, this paper argues that Saudi–UAE intervention is reshaping the MENA region through a multi-pronged approach incorporating military campaigns and an alignment of foreign aid with private capital investment priorities. The direct military intervention in Yemen and aid intervention in Egypt are highlighted as illustrations of overarching trends of Saudi–UAE intervention.

State survival bureaucracy (SSB): state sustainability after Arab revolutions,2019,"Purpose: Non-politicized bureaucracy plays a fundamental role in the survival of states during times of transition and drastic change. Moreover, non-politicized bureaucracy protects state institutions from failing. In fact, state survival bureaucracy (SSB), as an alternative to Deep State, obtains all mechanisms for the sustainability of the state, both its entity and identity. In case of resistance to the elected officials and executives’ abrupt decisions, professionals and experts came up with Deep State to reflect the elements of rejection. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses both system and function approaches in analyzing the role of bureaucracy in states going through transition. It also draws comparisons from the harsh experiences in the Arab region after Arab revolutions where most of the states collapsed while Tunisia and Egypt survived. The authors will use the available literature in reviewing different arguments regarding the role of bureaucracy in addition to the own observations as scholars who were engaged in the political process in Egypt for sometimes and during the drastic changes since January 25, 2011 and the knowledge about political process in Tunisia and other Arab states. Findings: In the study of the collapse of a number of Arab states and the survival of Tunisia and Egypt, it was found out that it is SSB which holds state together in cases of drastic changes or tangible threats. SSB includes bureaucrats and policy implementing agencies that are committed to both entity and identity of the state. The role of SSB emerges clearly in a state of utmost survival crisis of the state. SSB does inherently obtain self-correcting mechanisms that help states face, experience drastic change and cope with it.

Defending the Egyptian nation: National unity and Muslim attitudes toward the Coptic minority,2019,"This article discusses the Muslim discourse concerning the Coptic Christian minority since the 2000s in Egypt. Emphasizing the effects of the January 2011 uprising, the paper analyzes the role of nationalism and the national unity discourse in suppressing the debate regarding discrimination against the Copts. Despite the fissures that were created in the discourse, which rejects any reference to discrimination against the Copts, the Coptic issue remains trapped among the contested interpretations of national unity. All narratives of national unity and Egyptian essence, whether the official one pursued by the regime or the one promoted by pro-democracy activists, require the Copts to suppress their demand for rights for the sake of national unity. Adherence to the national unity discourse by all forces precludes the possibility of developing a form of nationalism or a national culture which embodies pluralism of identities and cultures and reinforces the role of nationalism as a tool for stifling pluralism and democracy for all Egyptians, whether Muslim majority or minorities.

Visualizing Inequality: The Spatial Politics of Revolution Depicted in Syrian Television Drama,2019,"Space has played a central and largely overlooked role in the Syrian conflict during the past eight years. A tension surrounds the organization of urban space and its impact on cultural identity, inequality, and political mobilization. Spatial politics represent a looming threat that is implicit in the project of ISIS, an international terrorist organization that seeks to appropriate the geographical area of al-Sham (Greater Syria) to create a transnational Caliphate. It also appears in the ‘development proposals’ of the Syrian government, which capitalize on a humanitarian crisis to expropriate forcibly displaced citizens of their land and properties.1 This article analyzes how Syrian television drama is not only an important field of cultural expression and a site of contestation but also reveals the many socioeconomic spatial tensions underlying the 2011 Revolution and its aftermath. The latter aspect is demonstrated through a visual and textual analysis of two television serials that depict the ‘ashwa’iyat,2 [arbitrary informal settlements of Damascus]. The first show, al-Intizar (2006), aired before the Syrian conflict. The second, Zawal (2016), aired as the political turmoil in Syria continued to unfold. This comparative analysis illustrates how the organization of urban space has impacted the dynamics of the Syrian Revolution and its aftermath, and how portrayals of urban and shanty town dramas portrayed the spatial inequalities of Damascus before and during the conflict.

It also powerfully anticipated the anti-Brotherhood apologetics used to rationalize the Rab‘a massacre of 2013, which effectively ended the revolution and cemented the coup by ‘Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi against Muhammad Morsy.

On the one hand, the uneven structure of opportunity upholding previous rule is central to the lack of pluralism.

In this paper, we examine what could best promote tolerance of least-favored political groups in such contexts. We use a survey experiment in Egypt to test competing theories through exposing respondents to different primes, emphasizing the importance of tolerance on the basis of religious, economic, or government endorsements. Respondents were then asked questions to gauge their tolerance levels toward their least-favored group. We control for the level of trust in government, religiosity, interpersonal trust, contact, and political knowledge. Our data show soaring levels of intolerance among Egyptians. However, we found evidence that priming respondents with the economic benefits of having a tolerant society is the most effective way to promote tolerant attitudes, especially among those with lower levels of education and younger age groups. Additionally, our analysis demonstrated that respondents’ level of trust in government has a strong effect on tolerance attitudes.

Determinants of political instability across Arab Spring countries,2019,"This paper investigates the determinants of political instability across Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region with special attention to the Arab Spring-affected region. The yearly data-set covers 19 countries in the MENA region for the period 1991–2014. The study uses pooled ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effect and random effect approaches. Our most robust result indicates that political instability in the region is very sensitive to exogenous food price shocks. Youth unemployment and regime durability are also strong predictors of unrest. The frustrated educated youth explanation of the Arab Spring is, however, not borne out by our study. The connection between the presence of democratic institutions and political unrest is more complex. Our results confirm other studies which find that more democracy leads to less unrest. On the other hand, our focused study of five Arab Spring countries and Egypt finds the reverse. Our results are sensitive to the ways in which the variables are defined.

The two first provisional administrations exhibited important differences. Key actors in the TPA were ‘soft-liners’ from the old regime and a network of civil society actors, while in the NTC armed groups soon became the most important actors.

Drawing on fieldwork in Egypt, as well as online reports and contestations of apparitions, visions, and dreams seen during the uprising, I suggest that accounts of the unseen pose a profound challenge to (and open up new possibilities for) doing ethnographic research, writing ethnography, and thinking anthropologically. Inspired by Michael Taussig, I suggest that the challenge is not to undo the invisible but to find a language that runs along the seam where the visible and the invisible connect and disconnect.

The Matter which may be: Sectarian Dilemmas of Materiality in Bahrain,2019,"This article discusses different approaches to materiality and material expressions of cultural identity in contemporary Bahrain, a small Arab Gulf state. Various Islamic traditions have different understandings of materiality and its ontological qualities. In the contemporary Gulf this difference is often understood as a sectarian difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims, a division that has gained increasing political importance in recent years. In this article I discuss how these traditions view materiality in religion, in particular focusing on the role of material mediation for Shia Muslims, exemplified by the use and meaning of the turba prayer stone. With this as a point of departure I discuss two other forms of materiality—political graffiti and martyr images—that in the wake of the uprising in 2011 have also been imbued with sectarian meanings, but where this is less clear. I therefore argue that vernacular understandings of material culture show ambiguous identifications that challenge the clear dichotomies with which people—locally and analytically —often operate.

Securitizing the Muslim Brotherhood: State violence and authoritarianism in Egypt after the Arab Spring,2019,"Unprecedented levels of state violence against the Muslim Brotherhood, and the widespread acceptance of this violence by Egyptians following the July 2013 military coup, have been under-examined by scholars of both critical security studies and Middle East politics, reflecting implicit assumptions that state violence is unexceptional beyond Europe. This article explores how the deployment of such levels of violence was enabled by a securitization process in which the Egyptian military successfully appropriated popular opposition to Muslim Brotherhood rule, constructing the group as an existential threat to Egypt and justifying special measures against it. The article builds on existing critiques of the Eurocentrism of securitization theory, alongside the writings of Antonio Gramsci, to further refine its application to non-democratic contexts. In addition to revealing the exceptionalism of state violence against the Muslim Brotherhood and highlighting the important role of nominally non-state actors in constructing the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to Egypt, the article also signals the role of securitization in re-establishing authoritarian rule in the wake of the 2011 uprising. Thus, we argue that securitization not only constitutes a break from ‘normal politics’ but may also be integral to the reconstitution of ‘normal politics’ following a period of transition.

Providing basic services under siege: preliminary insights from interim councils and medical providers in besieged urban areas of Syria,2019,"The interim councils and medical workers operating in besieged cities in opposition-held areas of Syria have faced enormous challenges in providing services to citizens. Despite the extremely difficult operating environment, some semblance of organized government has been installed by anti-regime rebels, whose functions include provision of basic services. Data collected from interviews with interim councils and medical workers in four opposition-held areas suggest that despite the acutely constrained environment and overwhelming challenges, governance structures there demonstrate a degree of success in delivering basic services to civilian populations. Their provision of basic services constitutes more than a bargaining tool or legitimacy signalling, and is better understood as an integral part of revolutionary struggle. Although producing an objective picture of events on the ground is hindered by the conflict conditions and heavy propaganda, the Syrian experience of service provision under siege merits further exploration and has relevance for other conflict environments.

"Wheat drought-tolerance to enhance food security in Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring",2019,"The beginning of the ‘Arab Spring’ in 2011, a regional revolution which started in the Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid in late 2010, occurred in part as a result of drought-triggered high wheat prices, which in the past led to ‘bread riots’ across several Middle East and North Africa (MENA) nations. Here we present, for the first time, an analysis of possible amelioration of wheat yield loss and greater stability in bread supply resulting from the incorporation of putative drought-tolerant traits into wheat cultivars grown in Tunisia. To this end, we used a simulation crop modeling approach using SSM-Wheat to evaluate yield loss or gain resulting from three types of water-saving traits that have been recently identified in wheat. These consisted in partial stomatal closure at high soil water content, overall decrease in transpiration rate (TR), and partial stomatal closure under elevated vapor pressure deficit (VPD). To capture large gradients in seasonal precipitation across wheat growing areas over a small country such as Tunisia, a grid pattern of 29 × 29 km was established as a basis for the geospatial simulation. Surprisingly, the simulation reflected opposite strategies in terms of water use (water-saving vs aggressive water use). The highest yield gain (30%) resulting from water-saving modification was found to occur in the food-insecure region of Sidi Bouzid. Traits enabling aggressive water use were found to be generally favorable across Tunisia, with one trait leading to up to 80% and 40% increases in yield and its stability in the food-challenged south of the country. However, major yield penalties were found to occur if water-saving traits were to be deployed in the ‘wrong’ region. Those findings could be used as a blueprint to navigate complex trait × environment interactions and to better inform local breeding and management programs to improve wheat yield and it stability in Tunisia and the MENA region in general.

"When political solutions for acute conflict in Yemen seem distant, demand for reproductive health services is immediate: a programme model for resilient family planning and post-abortion care services",2019,"The political situation in Yemen has been precarious since 2011 when popular protest broke out amid the Arab Spring, calling for President Saleh to step down. In March 2015, a Houthi insurgency took control of the capital, Sana’a and ignited a civil conflict that is now characterised by foreign political and military involvement. Since 2015, health facilities have been a primary target for airstrikes and bombing. Seaports have been blockaded barring the delivery of essential medicines and supplies, contributing to the near collapse of an already fragile health system. Since 2012, Save the Children (SC) has been implementing a Family Planning (FP) and Post-abortion Care (PAC) programme in two governorates heavily affected by the conflict. Despite the risks associated with the conflict, there remains a strong demand for SC's FP and PAC services. Ongoing programmatic support and capacity strengthening have allowed quality FP and PAC services to continue for Yemenis even when humanitarian access is impeded. Since the onset of conflict in March 2015, 16 facilities provided services to 43,218 new FP clients (with 23% accepting a long-acting method) and treated 3627 women with PAC. Over 93% of FP clients would recommend FP services at the facility to a friend or family member. Findings support growing evidence that women affected by conflict require family planning services, and that demand does not decline as long as quality services remain accessible. An adaptable reproductive health programme model that embraces innovative approaches is necessary for establishing services and maintaining quality during acute conflict.

Moroccan foreign policy after the Arab Spring: a turn for the Islamists or persistence of royal leadership?,2019,"This article explores the power balance between the Moroccan monarchy and the Islamist Party of Justice and Development (PJD) particularly within the field of Foreign Policy, in order to determine the extent to which the foreign policy decision-making process has changed since the 2011 constitutional reforms. More specifically, it investigates how the limited duality between the king and the government works in practice, beyond the legal text. Our contention is that both the revisited architecture as well as the implementation of the 2011 Constitution minimise the agency of the government and preserve the preponderance of the king and his entourage in matters of foreign policy. We examine this dynamic through a two-step analysis which, first, determines the patterns of Morocco's foreign policy with regards to its traditional allies in Europe and the Gulf and its growing relationship with non-traditional partners like China and, second, investigates whether these patterns apply to the kingdom's most recent foreign policy decisions in 2016 and 2017. We do this by undertaking an in-depth analysis of the kingdom's rapidly-changing relationship with Africa and Russia. This analysis allows us to closely examine and shed light on the main strategies of Morocco's foreign policy in a turbulent regional and international context; the central role of the king and the ambiguous decision-making process; and the relevance of new actors (technocratic and economic elites) and novel tools (economic and cultural diplomacies).

Post-conflict Syria: From destruction to reconstruction-Who's involved and to which extent,2019,"The wave of popular unrest in the Arab world reached Syria in March 2011, and what started as peaceful demonstrations with simple demands of justice and freedom turned into a brutal armed conflict and a full-scale civil war. Over seven years of conflict resulted in the deaths of over half a million Syrians, the forced displacement of millions more, and a huge loss of the country's social and physical structures. What began as another Arab Spring movement against a dictatorial regime has turned into a proxy war that has attracted the interests of the world and regional powers. The paper discusses Syria's political history and investigates the motives for the Syrian uprising and argues that it is related to socio-economic deprivations rather than sectarianism. The work underlines the interests of the countries involved in the Syrian conflict focusing on Russia, USA, Iran, and Turkey, as well as their contribution to the future reconstruction of the country. Over the past few years, the Syrian regime and its allies targeted many cities and destroyed opposition-held neighborhoods. The work considers if this destruction was part of an overall strategy adopted by the al-Assad regime to terrorize those who opposed it and change Syria demographically, examining the new laws issued by the government to transfer public properties into the hands of its loyal businessmen factions, as in the case of the reconstruction project in the city of Homs. Seven years of war exhausted Syria's financial stocks, and the country (and in turn the regime) is suffering the consequences of military spending. But like any other war, destruction is also a great opportunity to generate money through reconstruction and growth. It is a ""win-win situation"" the regime will use the fund designated for reviving the country to its own benefit, gaining future profits.

The deep roots of Libya’s security fragmentation,2019,"Six years after the 2011 revolution that toppled the Gaddafi regime, the political transition in Libya is at a standstill. The fragmented security landscape fuels chronic local conflicts, lawlessness, and insecurity, and paralyzes the political transition with destabilizing consequences on its neighbors. What explains the rapid, profound, and lasting security fragmentation that affected post-Gaddafi Libya? Notwithstanding the manifest failures of the international intervention during and after the 2011 conflict, this article argues that the security fragmentation in post-Gaddafi Libya is deeply rooted in domestic economic, cultural, and political factors. In particular, the Libyan economy offers almost no employment opportunities, and the country lacks a unitary government and functioning state institutions that it needs to redistribute its oil wealth. Under these circumstances, Libyans attempt to cope with economic hardship, insecurity, and lawlessness by turning towards their family, tribe, neighborhood, or ethnic group, thereby fueling the fragmentation of security. Libya’s current security fragmentation and instability can be seen as part of the messy historical process of state formation. During this phase, political and security agreements are brokered and institutionalized through localized processes of rebel governance whose realm of possible arrangements are determined by contextual economic, political and cultural constraints.

The discursive construction of ideologies and national identity in post-revolutionary Tunisia (2011–2017): the case of the Francophiles,2019,"In postcolonial countries the bilingual/bicultural elite played an undeniable role in the propagation of a modernist ideology about the nation and national identity. In Tunisia and in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring, this ideology has been seriously challenged by opposing discourses. Focusing on newspaper articles published by Tunisian Francophones, this article investigates the discursive strategies employed by this group to defend this ideology and its emergent national identity. Analysis is based on an inventory of the referential/predicational strategies developed within the Discourse Historical Approach to represent Self-Other identities [Reisigl, M., & Wodak, R. (2001). Discourse and Discrimination. London: Routledge]. Findings indicated a staunch defense of a de-ethninicized, de-racialized, multilingual and secular Tunisia. Attributes of Arabism/Islamism are consistently problematized; they are primitivized, religionized, de-intellectualized and negatively ideologized. By contrast, elements of Frenchness are championed on the basis of the modernist ideology they are thought to uphold. Frenchness is predicated on a continuum of Enlightenment, historicity, aesthetics, religious reformism and economic progress. This triumphalist rhetoric is, however, undermined by a discourse of language endangerment whereby the Francophiles deplore the possible loss of French in Tunisia. It is argued that while Frenchness will survive as part of Tunisian national identity and discourse tradition due to its strong anchoring in many domains, it seems that this Frenchified modernist identity politics has been transformed into a version which disavows its politicized, contingent and debatable nature. ","The discursive construction of ideologies and national identity in post-revolutionary Tunisia (2011–2017): the case of the Francophiles In postcolonial countries the bilingual/bicultural elite played an undeniable role in the propagation of a modernist ideology about the nation and national identity. In Tunisia and in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring, this ideology has been seriously challenged by opposing discourses. Focusing on newspaper articles published by Tunisian Francophones, this article investigates the discursive strategies employed by this group to defend this ideology and its emergent national identity. Analysis is based on an inventory of the referential/predicational strategies developed within the Discourse Historical Approach to represent Self-Other identities [Reisigl, M., & Wodak, R. (2001). Discourse and Discrimination. London: Routledge]. Findings indicated a staunch defense of a de-ethninicized, de-racialized, multilingual and secular Tunisia.

The democratic consequences of online media consumption in post-revolutionary Egypt,2019,"Considerable academic focus has been directed towards exploring the roles played by online media in initiating and shaping Egypt’s uprisings experienced since 2011. However, little is known about whether electronic media outlets remained a political agent in post-revolutionary Egypt or not. The current work seeks to redress this gap, relying on unique data collected in April 2016 from a representative sample of 1200 Egyptian adults. Findings show that electronic media consumption leads to increased demands for democratic regimes and negative positions towards Islamic governments. Furthermore, online media use enhances citizens’ protesting behaviour rather than voting action. In the online domain, electronic media exposure instigates more online political activism among online media users. Arguably, the current work concludes that online media have still been a potent democratizing actor in today’s Egypt as it had been during the 2011 and 2013 insurgencies, yet taking different forms and diverse degrees.

"Syria, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Qatar: The ‘sectarianization’ of thE syrian conflict and undermining of democratization in the region",2019,"Understanding the Syrian conflict only in terms of sectarian politics amounts to dismissing a very modern effort at emancipation within the context of the country’s populace fighting for its civil, political and economic rights, and in the process robs Syrians of their agency and diminishes their humanity. A closer look at events and political alignments in Syria reveals a more complex picture better understood through the lens of regimes’ desire to counteract the dissident and reformist dynamics that emerged with the Arab Spring. And while this paper is most certainly not minimizing the fact that the sectarian discourse and animosity, once activated, acquired its own dynamic, it underlines that this is not a case of so-called ancient sectarian rivalries emerging unprompted and of their own accord. As a result, the Syrian crisis and the regional ramifications of it can be appreciated as not simply identity politics writ large, but as an example of the authoritarian resilience paradigm in action. In making these arguments, this paper examines the interplay of the domestic and regional policies of three actors involved directly in the Syrian conflict: the Syrian regime, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.

High-Stakes Decision-Making Within Complex Social Environments: A Computational Model of Belief Systems in the Arab Spring,2019,"People experiencing similar conditions may make different decisions, and their belief systems provide insight about these differences. An example of high-stakes decision-making within a complex social context is the Arab Spring, in which large numbers of people decided to protest and even larger numbers decided to stay at home. This study uses qualitative analyses of interview narratives and social media addressing individual decisions to develop a computational model tracing the cognitive decision-making process. The model builds on work by Abelson and Carroll (1965), Schank and Abelson (a1977), and Axelrod (1976) to systematically trace the inferences connecting beliefs to decisions. The findings show that protest decisions were often based on positive emotions such as pride, hope, courage, and solidarity, triggered by beliefs about successful protest and self-sacrifice. By contrast, decisions to stay at home were triggered by beliefs about safety, state approval, and living conditions. As one participant said, “When I heard about the revolution in Tunisia, my heart was filled with solidarity for the people.” In the words of a non-participant: “When people are killed, we must be careful. There are more important things than protest: safety and stability.” This study of individual explanations about events identifies the role of emotions in high-stakes decision-making within complex social environments.

Doomed regionalism in a redrawn Maghreb? The changing shape of the rivalry between Algeria and Morocco in the post-2011 era,2019,"Since independence, intra-Maghrebi relations have been marked by a pattern of bilateral rivalry between Morocco and Algeria, which has conditioned the construction of the Maghreb and hampered regional integration initiatives. This article discusses the impact of political transformations on this longstanding pattern of behaviour since 2011. While shared perceptions of threat initially prompted a short-lived ‘defensive détente’ between the two countries, this rapprochement soon yielded to a new period of rivalry. Moreover, the sub-regional context in the area is tumultuous, due to the deterioration of the security situation in Mali and Libya. Once again, the zero-sum perspective that characterises Moroccan-Algerian relations has prevailed, preventing both countries from cooperating in tackling regional crises. Additionally, new arenas of rivalry have emerged in the Sahel, what some have called the ‘new security border for Europe’ and a space in which both countries are competing for the roles of stabilising force and regional mediator. Morocco has taken advantage of the growing interdependence around security issues between the Sahel and Maghreb after the collapse of the Libyan state and the instability in Mali to reposition itself as a regional actor in the Sahel space, challenging Algeria's traditional role in the region. The article examines the competition between the two countries to be seen by the international community as good partners, exporters of security and stability in the region. The rivalry has been reshaped in two principle areas: the competition for the role of mediator in the conflicts in Mali and Libya, and the competition to show expertise in the fight against terrorism and the processes of religious radicalisation. Finally, the rivalry between the two countries has extended into the rest of the African continent since Morocco's decision to abandon its empty-chair policy and join the African Union.

COMPETING HERITAGE: CURATING THE POST-CONFLICT HERITAGE OF ROMAN SYRIA∗,2019,"Since the beginning of the armed conflicts and public uprisings that accompanied and followed the ‘Arab Spring’ that started in 2010, cultural heritage sites have been hit hard, damaged and often destroyed by different perpetrators. The Syrian Civil War has resulted in unprecedented damage to cultural heritage sites, monuments, and facilities. This has provoked observers, politicians, and international and national non-government organizations to debate about the impacts of damaging Syria’s ‘irreplaceable’ patrimony and how to safeguard its past from the ongoing destructive actions. This paper investigates the transformation of the terminology of heritage—and the uses of heritage—in Syria before and during the ongoing conflict, and how the internationally renowned term ‘heritage’ emerged to promote the destruction of Syria’s cultural patrimony. This paper explores the semantics and impacts of the continuous destruction and the ongoing reconstruction plans on the cultural heritage of Syria. To conclude, I argue that those destructive actions started a process of ‘heritagizing’ the present which will eventually become a part of the Syrian collective memory.

This doctrinal position has been shaken up by new security threats coming from neighbouring countries. This article analyses the evolution of Algerian foreign policy since 2011, identifying the main constraints and obstacles that limit its ability to adapt to the new sub-regional context marked by the disintegration of the neighbouring states of Mali and Libya. Libya is in the midst of a massive security vacuum brought on by the absence of a central authority and a collapsing defence system. In Mali, in spite of the 2015 peace agreement designed to end the military and political crisis, the north is still facing high levels of violence and insecurity. This deteriorating regional security situation entails new challenges and dilemmas that are pushing Algeria to reconsider the normative foundations that have guided its foreign policy since independence, namely the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state, respect for state sovereignty and support for anticolonial and revolutionary movements. Furthermore, these security concerns are also closely connected with Algeria's domestic stability in terms of both state and regime security.

Between organization and spontaneity of protests: the 2010–2011 Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings,2019,"This paper investigates the role of social groups in mobilizing resources for protests in repressive contexts. In particular, it examines the impact of organizations and informal groups on individual engagement in the protests developed in 2010 in Tunisia and in 2011 in Egypt. The empirical analysis draws on the following data sources: the second wave of the Arab Barometer (2010–2011), two focus groups in Egypt conducted between 2011 and 2015 with members of trade unions and of Popular Committees who had participated in the 2011 protests in Egypt, eight semi-structured interviews conducted in 2017 to workers in Tunisia who had engaged in the 2010–2011 protests, and interviews conducted in January and February 2011 to 100 women in Tunisia within a study tackling police violence against women during the Tunisian uprisings. Findings show that both in Egypt and Tunisia protests were neither spontaneous nor fully organized as formal organizations and informal and spontaneous groups strictly interconnected in sustaining protests. In Egypt, established Islamic charity networks provided the structural basis for Popular Committees to engage in the 2011 protests and the initially spontaneous workers’ groups, institutionalized through the legalization of EFITU, were crucial for national wide protests occurred throughout 2011. In Tunisia, the major trade union UGTT was essential for mobilizing workers in the initial stages of protests but was backed by informal and spontaneous groups of workers during the process of protest diffusion. Results remark that the 2010–2011 Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings were therefore well-grounded on intermediate mobilizing structures capable to survive in the interstices of an authoritarian context. Findings suggest to consider that, in repressive context, spontaneous groups and more established and formal organizations continuously switch from one form to another, overlap, and transform themselves faster than they would do in democratic contexts.

Gaddafi was unpopular with the Arab and western leaders because of his independent occasional waywardness in the international discourse which was not palatable to the global and regional powers that were calling the shots in the UN and outside. Hence an engineered revolution supported by external military intervention aimed at removal of Gaddafi ensued but without any plan for the future because of which the seeds of current disastrous developments were implanted. All this became known in a few years thereafter and Libyan’s continued instability follows on. As for India which had good relations with Libya all through did not support the military intervention at the UNSC hence it was on the wrong side of the manufactured history and revolution and paid the price as popular dissatisfaction with India’s approach became visible in day to day discourse especially at the popular level.

Young people school-to-work transition in the aftermath of the Arab Spring: Early evidence from Egypt,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the school-to-work transition of young people from subsequent school exit cohorts between 2001 and 2012 in Egypt, thus, presenting an early evidence on the adjustments of the labor market in terms of patterns of youth transition to a first job following the 2011 Egyptian uprising. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis compares the early employment outcomes of those who left school after the January 25, 2011 uprising to that of those who left before 2011. The authors also separately control for the cohorts who left school in 2008 and 2009, in an attempt to disentangle any labor market adjustments that might have happened following the financial crisis, and before the revolution. Using novel and unexploited representative data from the 2014 Survey of Young People in Egypt (SYPE), the authors estimate the probability of transition to any first job within 18 months from leaving education and that of the transition to a good-quality job, controlling for the year of school exit. The authors also estimate the hazard of finding a first job and a good-quality job using survival analysis. Findings: School exit cohorts of 2008–2009 (following the financial crisis) and those of 2011–2012 (in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings) experienced a significantly higher likelihood of finding a first job within 18 months than that of the cohorts of 2001–2007. However, this came at the expense of the quality of job, conditional on having found a first job. The results of the hazard model show that school leavers after 2008 who were not able to transition to a job shortly after leaving school experienced longer unemployment spells than their peers who left school before 2007. The odds of finding a good-quality job appears to decline with time spent in non-employment or in a bad-quality first job. Originality/value: This paper contributes to a limited, yet growing, literature on how school-to-work transition evolved during the global financial crisis and the Egyptian 2011 revolution. Using data from SYPE 2014, the most recent representative survey conducted in Egypt on youth and not previously exploited to study youth school-to-work transition, the paper investigates the short-term adjustments of the youth labor market opportunities during that critical period of Egypt and the region’s history.

What's so Sectarian about Sectarian Politics? Identity Politics and Authoritarianism in a New Middle East,2019,"Shia/Sunni sectarianism figures prominently in post-Arab uprising claims that the Middle East is witnessing a darker kind of authoritarianism drawing on exclusionary and xenophobic forms of identity politics. This article explores whether sectarianism per se is associated with a distinct form of identity politics or if authoritarian techniques involving the use of the ‘sectarian card’ should be subsumed under a broader category of authoritarian identity politics involving the inclusion or exclusion of social groups based on identity and implemented with varying degrees of repression. The article shows how Brubaker's analytical distinction between a ‘diacritical’ and ‘normative ordering power’ understanding of religious identities gives rise to different expectations in regard to whether sectarianism leads to different and more violent forms of repression than other forms of identity politics. Against this background, the article compares authoritarian identity politics in Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, and Egypt, which all differ from each other both in terms of the importance of a Shia/Sunni distinction compared to other identity cleavages, and also as regards the intensity and level of the regime's response to the Arab uprisings. From this comparison five general lessons about sectarianism and authoritarian identity politics can be drawn. ","What's so Sectarian about Sectarian Politics?

Prospects for Kurdish Ecology Initiatives in Syria and Turkey: Democratic Confederalism and Social Ecology,2019,"This paper surveys the nascent experiments in political ecology underway in predominantly Kurdish areas of south-eastern Turkey, known as Bakûr, and Rojava (northern Syria). The Kurdish freedom movement is attempting to consolidate a social revolution with ecology at its heart in a most unpromising context, given its ongoing struggle against Islamic State and regional embargoes. This greening of its ideology can be significantly attributed to the influence of American social ecologist Murray Bookchin, an inspiration for Kurdish attempts to implement democratic confederalism, which comprises principles of direct democracy, gender equality and ecological well-being in a needs-based economy. The Mesopotamian Ecology Movement has emerged from activist campaigns opposing dam construction, climate change and deforestation in the region, to inform ecology councils tasked with formulating policies that reflect this philosophical paradigm shift. The essay considers the prospects for the ecological initiatives in Turkish and Syrian Kurdistan. It argues that, confronted by formidable challenges, expansion of the democratic confederal model beyond the heartlands of Bakûr and Rojava, and international solidarity, are preconditions for their endurance.

The Location of Truth: Bodies and Voices in the Italian Asylum Procedure,2019,"This article analyzes the role increasingly played by oral testimony in asylum procedures in the years 2011–2013, when the “Arab spring” and the war on Libya caused a sudden increase in the number of migrants entering Italy, as well as a peak in rejections. Drawing from ethnographic cases, I suggest that in Italy this shift was based on assumptions about the scientific objectivity and neutrality of interviewing and translation techniques. I argue that such assumptions fall apart under scrutiny by revealing all assessment techniques (both of written evidence and oral testimony) as spaces of contestation. Furthermore, I suggest that they conceal the sharp hardening of European asylum politics under supposedly neutral technicalities. At times of a perceived “refugee crisis,” the mere assessment of the oral narrative allowed for easier and speedier rejections.

"Insurgent citizenship: Youth, political activism and citizen cinema in post-2011 Morocco",2019,"The uprisings that swept across North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 brought to world attention the revolutionary potential of youth in the face of social injustice and political repression. This article explores how the so-called Arab Spring foregrounded Moroccan youth’s alternative conceptions of citizenship and being young in the MENA region today. Using the emergence of citizen cinema as a case study, I will examine the subjective politics of Moroccan youth’s alternative to dominant political and social authority. Made, self-produced and distributed online free of charge by a young and self-avowed citizen filmmaker, Nadir Bouhmouch’s debut documentary My Makhzen and Me (2012) does not pretend to offer an objective account of Morocco’s so-called Arab Spring. Instead, the filmmaker focuses on relating his own personal story as a young upper-class Moroccan student in San Diego, who returned to the country in the summer of 2011 armed with a camera as his weapon in the February 20 Movement’s battle for democratic citizenship and social justice in Morocco. In this article, I will show how the subjective point of view structuring this documentary offers a unique perspective not only on Morocco’s Arab Spring but also on the impossibility of representing citizenship objectively on the documentary camera. The article ultimately argues that because the personal is always already political in North African documentary filmmaking since 2011, the subjective point of view allows for the emergence of the insurgent citizenship of the region’s youth.

Egypt's cultural heritage in conflict situations: examination of past and present impact,2019,"In recent decades, the remarkable cultural heritage of Egypt has been threatened by loss or damage due to many conflict situations. These have led to looting, smuggling, vandalism, encroachment, illegal activities, and many more threats which put the fate of Egypt’s heritage in jeopardy of disappearance and demolition. The loss of Egyptian heritage is not only a loss of history, but of cultural identity, memory and existence. These types of threats are by no means a recent phenomenon, but have been going on for centuries.

Furthermore, it also examines the severe crisis that endangered Egyptian heritage in the 21st century, notably the aftermath of the 2011 Revolution and the subsequent, widespread pillaging of archeological sites and museums. These recent conflicts highlighted concerns about the future of Egyptian antiquities and their protection, and raised serious concerns about how to protect Egyptian patrimony and preserve the collective cultural memory of Egypt.

Syrian-Lebanese relations: A corpus-based critical discourse analysis of Bashar Al-Assad’s speeches and interviews,2019,"This paper contributes to the recent body of work which combines Critical Discourse Analysis with the methodological framework of Corpus Linguistics to analyse Syria’s relations with other countries, in particular Lebanon, in the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s speeches and interviews from July 2000 when Al-Assad came to power to December 2016. It shows how this combination of approaches can play an important role in demonstrating how Al-Assad makes use of language to affect the text receivers’ points of view. Following Wodak (2009) Discourse Historical Approach (DHA), the researcher divided the data, which is in Arabic, into two main corpora, based on the historical background of Syrian-Lebanese relations, covering the periods (i) 2000-2010, characterised by the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon (2000-2004) and their subsequent withdrawal (2005-2010), and (ii) 2011-2016, characterised by the Syrian uprisings which have begun in 2011. The analysis reveals that Lebanon is portrayed as a subordinate state and that the Syrian regime intervenes in the Lebanese internal affairs, even though Al-Assad has frequently denied such a claim.

Was drought really the trigger behind the Syrian Civil War in 2011?,2019,"The role played by unsustainable resource management in initiating international conflicts is well documented. The Syrian Civil War, commencing in March 2011, presents such a case. The prevailing opinion links the unrest with sequential droughts occurring from 2007-2010. Our research, however, reveals that the winter-rainfed agricultural conditions before 2011, as detected by satellite-derived vegetation indices, were similar and even better for Syrian farmers than for those of their Turkish counterparts across the border. Concurrently, summer-irrigated crops, heavily dependent on Euphrates River water originating from Turkey, notably declined in Syria while flourishing in Turkey. These findings are firmly supported by other independent and validated datasets, including long-term cross-border discharge, the water level in Syrian and Turkish reservoirs, and transborder groundwater flow. We conclude that the Turkish policy of unilaterally diverting the Euphrates water was the main reason for the agricultural collapse and subsequent instability in Syria in 2011. The obvious inference is that while prolonged drought exacerbated conditions, unsustainable anthropogenic water management in Turkey was the proximate cause behind the Syrian uprising.

Two Novels about the Information War in Yemen on the Eve of the Revolution of 2011; [Два романа об информационной войне в Йемене в первом десятилетии XX века],2019,"Around the mid–1990s, President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime in Yemen began to realize the rapid decline in its popularity among the citizens. Total corruption, unemployment, unprecedented poverty growth, stagnation of all social services — all this turned the lives of thousands of Yemenis into daily struggle for survival. In the conditions of Yemeni population’s growing discontent, one of the regime’s instruments to keep control over the situation was the state media which implemented all means of propaganda to improve the image of the government in the eyes of the citizens. At the same time, printed and electronic publications of the opposition movements confronted the state media by revealing their lies and explaining to the readers the authoritarian and corrupt nature of the ruling regime. This information war which lasted until the fall of the regime in 2011 became the main theme of two Yemeni novels: War under the Skin (2010) by Aḥmad Zayn (Zein) and Happy Land of Intrigues (2018) by Wajdī al-Ahdal. Aḥmad Zayn concentrates on the inner world of his protagonist, a journalist working for the regime, and shows how he gradually comes to the understanding of his negative role in the information war.

Saudi Arabia–Iran contention and the role of foreign actors,2019,"The Sykes–Picot Agreement, the Iranian Revolution, the Gulf Wars, and other events that have unfolded after the Arab Uprising (the Arab Spring), have altered the course of West Asian history. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the new architects determining the course and its trajectory; also significant is the presence of foreign powers. As is evident that oil has been a crucial factor behind the West’s interests in the region. The article states that the new Cold War can be explained as a variance between Iran and Saudi Arabia; and the situation manoeuvred by foreign actors. The region’s geostrategic significance coupled with resource politics and aspiring influence, apart from the sectarian dimension, has been the motivating factor for the emergent squabble between the regional and global players. Much of it can be seen in the context of the geostrategic energy war in Syria, proxy wars in countries like Yemen and political unrest in Bahrain, also risking smaller vulnerable states like Qatar and Lebanon. The article argues that the current situation is a product of a struggle between the two regional powers and the positioning of the US and Russia in the changing dynamics. It evaluates the continuing adversity, emphasising that the crisis is significantly driven by geo-economic factors, and is not merely confined to the regional hegemony aspect.

The relationship between remittances and macroeconomic variables in times of political and social upheaval: Evidence from Tunisia's Arab Spring,2019,"If Tunisia is hailed as a success story with its high rankings on economic, educational, and other indicators relative to other Arab countries, the popular 2011 uprisings underscored the fragility of its main economic pillars, including those of tourism and foreign direct investment. This paper examines the economic impact of migrants’ remittances, which are expected to exhibit relatively countercyclical behaviour during periods of intense upheaval. This study is novel in its methodological approach, which is used to pinpoint the dynamic effects of remittances on key macroeconomic variables within an unstable framework. The analysis reveals that the effect of remittances on Tunisia's economy has varied over time. Prior to the Arab Spring, remittances had a short-term negative influence on economic growth, varying effects on domestic investment and positive impacts on consumption. In considering the post-Arab uprisings, positive and strong impacts of remittances on growth and consumption are found in the long run while negative and moderate investment effects of remittances are shown over the short and medium term.

Local mobilisations and the formation of environmental networks in a democratizing Tunisia,2019,"This study examines the environmental protests that occurred in Tunisia after the 2011 uprisings. It analyses the factors underpinning the rise of the environmental networks during the period of transition (2011–2014). It details the mobilising strategies that were crucial for the networks’ growth or survival during this period of institutional instability. The study shows how networks leaders were able to bring together social and political actors from different backgrounds and ideological orientations. It is argued that the ability of networks to develop new distinctive collective identities was crucial for network sustainability. Those networks and actors who did not develop new clearly defined environmental identities and continued to rely importantly on pre-existing (authoritarian) structures and practices were more negatively impacted by ideological cleavages and political calculations. Empirically, the contribution builds on interviews and observations, as well as documents collected from Tunisian municipalities between 2013 and 2015. Conceptually, the research proposes a bottom-up perspective that highlights the interplay between micro- and macro-dynamics and strategies during a political transition. The analysis details the actors’ capacity to build alliances via interpersonal relations at the micro level, and their strategies to engage with institutional actors and processes.

Dynamic interactions among the industrial sector and its determinants in Jordan,2019,"The industrial sector is one of the most vital sectors in the national economy, so different local and global factors affect its performance. The study examines the impact of the global and local macroeconomic variables on the industrial index of the Amman Stock Exchange. This study covered the period from January 2007 to December 2016, which is considered as a crucial period in the Middle Eastern countries. This period encompasses the worldwide economic meltdown from 2007 to 2008, the Arab spring of 2010 and the wars in Syria and Iraq from 2012 to 2014. The macroeconomic variables used in this study as domestic variables from Jordan were the deposit interest rate (IN), inflation rate (INF), money supply 2 (MS2), trade balance (TR), producer price index (PPI) and the industrial production index (IPI). At the same time the global oil price (WTI) was used as a global factor to measure the external shocks. This study used the ARDL bound testing approach to examine the co-integration, short-run and long-run relationships. Moreover, Granger causality test was used to detect the causality relationship in the short and long run between the selected macroeconomic indicators and the industrial index. It was found out that the inflation rate positively influenced the industrial index, which provides some evidence that the industrial sector in Jordan acts as a hedge against inflation. In addition, the global oil price showed a significant negative impact on the industrial sector. Some important implications for investors, government bodies, and policymakers are discussed.

The frequency domain causality analysis brings a dynamic dimension to the study, and facilitates the examination of potential relationships between oil prices and the Kuwait stock market over the period under study (1995 to 2016). Interestingly, the research findings did not offer significant evidence on the existence of a long run association between Brent oil prices and Kuwait’s major stock price index. Short-run dynamics were identified as follows: i) unidirectional causality was found between Brent and the Kuwait stock market, a result was not confirmed during the Arab Spring event; ii) the dynamic causality test revealed a unidirectional relationship from oil to the stock market only during the Iraq invasion. The findings indicate that market players should benefit from monitoring short-run dynamics in the context of the Kuwait Stock Exchange.

The study employed the qualitative method through the use of direct interviews with a sample of public and private tourism bodies in Jordan. The study findings indicate, on one hand, the presence of negative effects on the tourism sector in Jordan, especially with regard to regulations applied on tourism bodies and dealing with tourists such as rising entry fees for tourism destinations, delays in the issuance of documents and visas for inbound tourists, as well as the weakness of tourism promotion in the media. On the other hand, the study pointed to the positive results that have enriched the tourism sector as a result of the Arab Spring crisis. For instance, many international tourists have preferred to travel to Jordan instead of other neighbours’ countries in the region due to best practices of crisis management in Jordanian tourism authorities and the availability of trained tourism staffs that have experiences in safety procedures and crisis management. Finally, the study showed the need to broaden the practices and procedures in the revitalization of the tourism sector to encounter ongoing challenges.

However, of the events and developments that made the Arab spring revolution in Libya different from those in other Arab countries, one such issue is the participation of non-Arab ethnic group in the Libyan revolution. This ethnic group is the Amazigh people. They are one of the basic and ancient components of Libyan society, which is characterized by its unique language and cultural heritage which is different from the Arab language and cultural heritage. This ethnic group was treated differently byMuammar Al Qaddafi government, which was the cause of their (Amazighs’) participation in the revolution against him. ",['lby'],CW,False,True,False,2
Domestic and Regional Contexts of the Royal Jordanian Discussion Papers: what does the Monarch Want?,2019,"This article seeks to shed light on the visions of the King of Jordan Abdullah II and to analyze them based on what is named the “Royal Discussion Papers” which amount to 7 Papers spanning the years 2012 until 2017.

These RDP may be considered one of the methods and tools of the Jordanian monarch to tackle the issues and crises facing the Jordanian State, through which are manifested the vision of the Jordanian State on the one hand, and the impact of political, economic and security transformations in the region and the world on the other hand, particularly in the stage of what is called the “Arab Spring” 2011 stage until the present time. Despite the repeated promises in these RDP, particularly the first five Papers, to achieve “political reform” by opening horizons for creating a Jordanian political system (parliamentary government) under which the King is like the monarch of Britain “who reigns but does not rule” as the opposition is demanding, these promises have not been fulfilled at all, particularly since the winds of the Arab Spring have calmed down and do not anymore constitute “an existential threat” to the King and the Kingdom. This actually means that the RDP were no more than a “tool” to overcome the difficult political, economic and security conditions through which the Kingdom was passing rather than being a firm “strategy” in the direction of “political reform” to face the future and its challenges.

The Balancing Act in a Military-Dominated Transition to Democracy in Egypt After the Arab Spring,2019,"This article genealogically traces the historical development of democracy in Egypt and the military and Islamists’ involvement in politics since the British occupation in Egypt in 1882, following the semi-independence in 1922, through the 1952 revolution, and up to the revolutionary waves of the Arab Spring of January 25, 2011 and June 30, 2013. In this article, the author provides perceptual and analytical insight into the outcome of the Arab Spring of 2011 within the complicated realities of Egypt's politics during the transition to democracy, where the military and Islamists are competing to retain power in order to shape Egypt's future. The author argues that it is too early to make a judgmental argument that the transition to democracy has failed since the process of democratization is long and not linear, with periods of political trajectories while adapting in response to national, regional, and international events, dynamics, and forces. The research concludes that the coping models of democracy from outside of the Egyptian context may not work. Egypt should develop its own model of democracy based on an all stakeholders consensus accompanied by an incremental process of demilitarizing and desecuritizing the nation.

From the Fragments Up: Municipal Margins of Maneuver in Syria and Tunisia,2019,"Most studies of the Arab uprisings and their aftermaths focus on national-level political processes, neglecting changes at the municipal level. The few studies of municipalities that do exist tend to treat municipalities either as corruption-prone institutions exploited by local elites, or else as areas in need of intervention to make them function properly. We argue that municipalities are an overlooked site of political change-both spatially and temporally-that began prior to the uprisings but accelerated in their aftermath. Drawing on original empirical material from Tunisia and Syria between 2007 and 2014, we highlight two changing dimensions of municipal governance: How municipalities have sought to expand their power by stretching into new areas; and how, since the uprisings, municipalities have taken up new regulatory and enforcement roles in the wake of central state retreat. To support this analysis, we utilize on-the-ground interviews and fieldwork in Tunisia and off-site interviews and aerial analyses of urban growth in northern Syria. We find that, first, city governments are moving into the spaces where national actors are absent, transforming municipalities into spaces for meaningful political engagement (Tunisia) and the allocation of resources (Syria). Second, municipalities have gained greater autonomy in the arenas of service delivery and planning. This increase in municipal power does not represent a break from pre-uprising practices, but rather a continuation and perhaps acceleration of the politicization and expansion of municipal authority that began pre-2011.

A Tale of Two Movements: Egypt during the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street,2019,"Social media provides flexible platforms that play key roles in energizing collective action in movements like Arab Spring (AS) and Occupy Wall Street (OWS). By enabling individuals to display emotions broadly, social media amplify sentiments defined as shared collective emotion to supply the forces that drive change in society. This study describes how one platform, Facebook, contributed to these two different examples of political activism. Using social network analytics and text mining, we examine how Fan Page posts during the life of the movements influenced the formation of social ties by using sentimental messaging. We hypothesize a set of relationships between group cohesion and polarity of sentiments in explaining involvement. We find that the strength of social ties formed through exchanges of posts and comments influence participation, but its effect differs across two movements. We also find that negative sentiments are associated with more participation for Egypt during the AS than OWS. Our results suggest cultural differences play a major role in participation behaviors. Social media is important in engineering management, because someone who has a negative reaction to a project or a product can use these media to reach thousands of individuals and potentially turn sentiment against a project.

Political Participation of Islamists in Syria: Examining the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood's Mid-century Democratic Experiment,2019,"Accompanying increased participation by Islamists in parliaments across the Middle East in the past two decades, there continues to be a debate as to the sincerity of their commitment to democratic values and systems. Scholars have traditionally pursued the issue through the inclusion/moderation model, or through concepts such as ‘post-Islamism’. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, however, represents a rare case for the study of Islam and democracy because its democratic engagement preceded its later period of violent and ideological radicalism by decades. The group contested elections within the first two years of its formation, meaning that its positions on democracy were ‘moderated’ neither by pluralist political pressures nor by the failure of a previous non-democratic ideology. This article therefore examines the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood's performance in Syria's political processes between 1947 and 1963 as a case study of Islamism and democracy, evaluating substantive indicators of democratic engagement, such as electoral practices, pact formation, policy adaptation and approaches to executive government. Using recent interviews with Brotherhood members, memoirs, archival material and newspapers, the article argues that, during this time, while the Brotherhood was not the most effective political actor, it did demonstrate a reasonably diligent commitment to democracy.

We study if (i) a shock to democracy in one country triggers institutional reforms and growth upsurge in the neighbouring countries, and (ii) the magnitude and direction of response to democracy shocks are contingent upon income pathways of countries. To estimate the spillover effects of democracy shocks, we model and estimate growth interdependence among individual countries with similar democratic characteristics. To study the nature of responses of democracy shocks on cross-country growth processes, we build and estimate a Global Vector Autoregression (GVAR) model where we allow countries to be interdependent with regard to bilateral migration and geographical proximity. Using the GVAR model, we also stimulate a positive shock to democracy in Egypt-the most populous Arabic country-and study its impacts on institutional reforms and economic growth in the rest of the Arab World. We find that high and upper-middle income countries are immune to democracy shocks in Egypt, whereas the lower middle and low income countries are susceptible to another revolutionary wave.

"Public feminism, female shame, and sexual violence in modern Egypt",2019,"This paper examines the interconnections between public sexual violence, female shame, and public feminism in modern Egypt. It connects aspects of public sexual violence against women generally and politicized sexual violence in 21st-century Egypt in particular, arguing that successive political regimes in Egypt produce and maintain a spatial culture of humiliation and inferiorization as a political tool of silencing, and oppressing women and opposition. This culture of humiliation and inferiorization is premised upon media-oriented female shame ideas that relate and condemn female sexuality and public participation, establishing the public space as militarized, dangerous and exclusive. This paper attempts to assess the successes and failures of public feminism in Egypt in addressing such politicized culture of female humiliation and isolation in public spaces, with a particular focus on fighting politicized forms of sexual violence directed against women in post-2011 revolutionary Egypt. It argues further that sexual violence against women and the repression of public feminism in Egypt are parts of the failure of the processes of democratic transition, state formation and of the survival of socio-economic and cultural hierarchy and vulnerability in modern Egypt. The paper maintains that Egyptian women's remarkable and solid public activism during and after 2011-revolution shows them as able to invade the exclusive public spaces and hence are able to create new spaces of female resistance and new forms of public mobilization in the country.

It argues further that sexual violence against women and the repression of public feminism in Egypt are parts of the failure of the processes of democratic transition, state formation and of the survival of socio-economic and cultural hierarchy and vulnerability in modern Egypt. The paper maintains that Egyptian women's remarkable and solid public activism during and after 2011-revolution shows them as able to invade the exclusive public spaces and hence are able to create new spaces of female resistance and new forms of public mobilization in the country.

Iran's Syria strategy: The evolution of deterrence,2019,"Iran has been a critical player in the Syrian war since 2011, crafting a complex foreign policy and military strategy to preserve its Syrian ally. What have been the drivers of Iranian decision-making in this conflict? And how has Iranian strategy evolved over the course of the war? This article argues that the logic of deterrence has been fundamental not just for shaping the contours of Iran-Syria relations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, but also for determining the overall trajectory of Iranian strategy in the Syrian war. The authors outline Iran's decision-making calculus and divide the country's strategy on Syria after the Arab Spring into four primary phases: 1) a â' Basij' strategy to establish local militias in Syria; 2) a regionalization strategy to incorporate transnational fighters and militias in the war effort; 3) an internationalization strategy to incorporate Russia and balance the United States; and 4) a post-ISIS deterrence strategy to balance against the United States, Turkey and Israel. Iran's Syria strategy progressively escalated in response to the possible defeat of its ally and the deterioration of its forward deterrence capacities against the United States and Israel. Today, the potential for direct inter-state conflict is rising as proxy warfare declines and Iran attempts to maintain the credibility of its forward deterrence.

Progressive realisation of muslim family law: The case of Tunisia,2019,"From the time when women's rights were not placed high on the agenda of any state to the time when women's rights are given top priority, Tunisia's gender-friendly legislation requires a fresher look. One would be forgiven for thinking that Tunisia's reforms started after they gained independence from France in the 1950's. In fact, it was during the French Protectorate that reformers started rumours of reform, arguing amongst other issues for affording women more rights than those they were granted under sharia law, which governed family law in Tunisia. After gaining its independence, Tunisia promulgated the Code of Personal Status, which was considered a radical departure from the sharia. It is considered to be the first women-friendly legislation promulgated in the country. It could be argued that Tunisian family law underwent, four waves of reform. The first wave started during the French Protectorate. The second wave started in the 1950's with the codification of Tunisia's family law, which introduced women-friendly legislation. The third wave started in the 1990's with changes to the Code of Personal Status, and the latest wave commenced in 2010. In this article, I analyse the initial, pioneering phases of the reforms resulting from the actions of a newly formed national state interested in building a free society at the end of colonial rule, as well as reforms that have taken place in the modern state since the Arab uprising in Tunisia. As a result of the various waves of reforms, I argue that Tunisia should be seen as the vanguard of women-friendly legislation in the Arab world.

Kazakhstan in the arab spring context,2019,"The authors have analyzed the Arab Spring, which caused an outburst of T radical Islamism and echoed in the sociopolitical and economic context of Central Asia. The subject has gathered a lot of importance because of rising extremism that threatens national security of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The authors have posed themselves with the task of delineating the general provisions and specific situations related to the problem of extremism in Kazakhstan, as well as the measures needed to lower the level of radicalization of different population groups, first and foremost, the younger generations, and prevent their involvement in terrorist activities. This is achieved by accomplishing three tasks: to explain in which way the Arab Spring affected Central Asia, first and foremost, in the form of terrorist activities; to reveal the global nature of the problem of religious extremism, the measures needed to prevent its spread among the younger generation and the mechanisms of protecting our country against the ideas of terrorism; to create and improve the legal, normative, organizational and other mechanisms of power of the Republic of Kazakhstan designed to oppose the ideology of terrorism. We have concentrated on the driving forces, impacts of the Arab Spring, its role in the contemporary history of the Republic of Kazakhstan and deemed it absolutely necessary to pay particular attention to the place Kazakhstan occupies in the processes that are pushing the world towards a new world order. The type of radical activities in Kazakhstan, and in the Central Asian region for that matter, changed significantly under the pressure of the Middle Eastern crisis, which has been unfolding since 2011. Today, Syria and Iraq attract mercenaries from all corners of the world. The events in the Middle East forced many people to ask themselves whether the Arab Spring can be repeated in Central Asia; whether Arab revolutions can be continued there, how these processes might affect the region and, last but not least, how the Arab Spring echoed in other regions, what place Kazakhstan occupies and will occupy in the near future in the international balance of power and how this will affect the region’s security. The impact of the Arab Spring, which is a multidimensional phenomenon, has spread far and wide outside the Middle East. This means that what happened and is happening there had already affected the interests of the United States, Russia, the European Union, Turkey, Iran, China and other countries which share Kazakhstan’s international and geopolitical interests.

Labour and democracy in the Maghreb: The Moroccan and Tunisian trade unions in the 2011 Arab Uprisings,2019,"This article focuses on the part played by Moroccan and Tunisian labour in the 2011 Arab Uprisings and their outcomes, aiming to add fresh evidence to the long-standing debate over the place of social classes in democratisation processes. In Morocco, most labour confederations supported a new constitution that did not alter the undemocratic nature of the political system. In Tunisia, instead, rank-and-file trade unionists successfully rallied the single labour confederation in support of the popular mobilisations, eventually contributing to democratisation. The most important facilitating factor for these divergent processes and outcomes was the different level of working-class power existing in the two countries. On the eve of the Uprisings, working-class power was higher in Tunisia than in Morocco and this enabled Tunisian workers to mobilise more effectively. Democratisation in Tunisia, however, has so far failed to address the demands for social justice that were at the core of the Uprisings.

Understanding the discourse of Ali Jum Ah on the military coup during the Arab spring in Egypt,2019,"This article aims to propose an alternative explanation to the existing scholarship about the factors behind the failure of Egypt to transform into a democratic country after having experienced the major moment of the Arab Spring. I argue that the theological discourse of the ulama and their commitment to one of the currents of Islamic political thought in the premodern period contributed to the miscarriage of the Arab Spring. In doing so, I focus on unpacking the discourse of the previous grand mufti of Egypt, Ali Jum ah (Ali Gom'ah), on the military coup against the democratically elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood, Muammad Mursi (Mohammed Morsi). On several occasions, Jumah conveyed discourses that supported and justified the actions of the military leaders who took power. I trace Ali Jumah's discourse on the coup through three medieval scholars' views on the usurpation of power (al-istila alá l-imarah). I compare Ali Jumah's discourse to that of al-Mawardi, al-Ghazali, and Ibn Jamaah, three prominent political theorists and jurists in the medieval period. I argue that the tendency to conform with tradition led Ali Jumah to formulate his undemocratic discourse. In this article, I examine several notions from the Islamic legal field that Ali Jumah employed to justify the coup. I also argue that in addition to following the standard norms from the medieval period, Ali Jumah also departed from such norms in several aspects. I contend that his discourse during the Arab Spring has had severe implications for both the Islamic legal field and the political trajectory of Egypt.

The finger on the scale: International interventions in the Middle East and North Africa following the Arab Spring,2019,"Following the Arab Spring, each regime that confronted mass protests selected from a range of repressive and concessionary tactics in the effort to remain in power. In five cases-Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen-regimes eventually resorted to using violent repression with participation from national military forces. However, these regimes experienced a variety of outcomes related to their ability to preserve their authority. These outcomes were greatly impacted by the interventionist strategies they faced from foreign powers. We argue that the nature of the international interventions best explains the outcomes for the regimes in question. Foreign powers intervened both to support and to confront existing regimes, providing explanations of why certain regimes survived, collapsed, or came to share territorial sovereignty with oppositional groups during civil wars. Thus, regime survival in the Middle East and North Africa following popular uprisings may depend on the effective management of international support as much as on regime control over national military forces or the repression of social opposition.

Zooming in on micro-sociological pro-cesses provides not only a detailed narrative of the events, but also a recognition of dynamics that are often overlooked, notably how particular forms of repression make people gather in solidarity and outrage, energizing further counter-action, whereas other forms of repression involving torture, imprisonment, and injuring, but no visible, lethal violence can de-energize a protest movement.

Are Monarchies Exceptional to the Arab Uprisings? The Resilience of Moroccan Monarchy Revisited,2019,"With the onset of the Arab uprisings at the end of 2010 and the emergence of popular demonstrations that raised the issue of crises of legitimacy across the Arab states, the literature on democratization in the Middle East and North African (MENA) studies has taken on new dimensions recently. One of the primary theoretical debates that has surfaced in the post-2011 era has revolved around on whether or not the demonstrations will lead to regime change or increased authoritarianism in the MENA region. One of the crucial developments of the Arab Spring has, then, been the overthrow of some long-standing rulers like Ben Ali of Tunisia and Mubarak of Egypt, as well as the questioning of authoritarian regimes by the masses. The public protests submerged some Arab republics, but monarchies found ways to overcome the public outcry through containing the opposition. This paper, therefore, takes the monarchy of Morocco as a case study with the aim of analyzing the methods and regime-survival strategies the regime has employed to sustain itself and consolidate power in the post-2011 Arab uprisings era. Additionally, the role of the Justice and Development Party as an emerging threat in the postdemocratization era, and the changing nature of the party’s relations with the palace, will be addressed.

Giving voice to the voiceless: vulnerable refugees in Lebanon,2018,"Seven years on, Syria’s Arab Spring has mutated into a civil war marked by attacks by President Assad against civilian communities, interventions by foreign powers and the rise of the so-called Islamic State, Nusra Front and numerous other terrorist organisations. This research report focusses on Mar Elias camp, the smallest Palestinian refugee camp in the heart of Beirut, now inhabited by a large number of refugees from Syria. The aim is to record the voices and concerns of refugees from Syria. Through doing so, it looks beyond a narrow focus on radicalisation and terrorism recruitment within the camp. Instead, the refugee’s needs, and the human security and protection challenges they are faced with are outlined. This study adopts a participatory approach involving direct interviews with Syrian refugees in every stage of the research process. The research focuses on the perceptions, lived experiences and expectations of Syrian refugees, and the Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS) population. The aim is to grant a voice to the voiceless, record their own narratives, and to offer them the opportunity to report on the security challenges that confront them. The research is an outcome of nine months of humanitarian fieldwork in the Mar Elias camp as a community development project officer on the project ‘Urban Neighbourhoods Mobilised to Respond to WASH (water, hygiene and sanitation), Shelter and Protection Needs.’ Information was gathered during focus group discussions, needs assessments and one-on-one interviews. The participatory research is significant since it allows people to be actively involved in defining their priorities and seeking solutions and facilitates the study of perceptions, and caters for marginalised and vulnerable groups. It is hoped to show how through participatory research, marginalised people can raise their concerns and have their voices heard in order to allow for more accurate information about the communities involved, and to question assumptions such as those that prioritise framing security within the camps in the narrow context of counter terrorism.

Climate impact on surface and groundwater in North Africa: a global synthesis of findings and recommendations,2018,"Climate change is having short- and long-term impacts on surface and groundwater in the northern part of the African continent.

Among such pressures, we can cite the mal-distribution and the irregularity of precipitation and ice, flooding, evaporitic sediments input by the drainage net, water degradation, mud stagnation in dams, dead tranche, drought, decreasing of the natural recharge and increasing of the groundwater abstraction, conflict between trans-boundary waters, desertification, imbalance between the regions, migration, revolution, socio-economic imbalance, etc. Actually, water-monitoring networks indicate noticeable hydrogeologic variations and a rise of the groundwater salinity.

Anti-Terrorism Laws in the Maghreb Countries: The Mirror of a Democratic Transition that Never Was,2018,"This article sheds light on the counter-terrorism measures enacted by the Maghreb countries, with a comparative approach of the laws in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Carried out by comparing the Arabic and French original versions, the analysis revealed a common attitude that tended to preserve national security at the expenses of civil freedoms and human rights. In almost all cases, anti-terrorism laws strayed away from their supposed initial finality – fighting terrorism – tackling other issues such as the maintenance of public order or indirectly the control of dissidence and political opposition, with no or scarce legal checks and balances that could restrict possible police or judiciary abuses towards civil and political rights. The legal measures significantly delayed both the first transition to democracy in the region in the 2000s as well as the promising development after the ‘Arab spring’.

The effect of branding on orientation and coaching: The mediating role of hotel culture,2019,"The Tourism industry in the Middle East has gone through a myriad of challenges in the last decade mostly attributed to the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring revolutions of 2010 in countries including Tunisia, Morocco, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Bahrain, were marred with protests and violence, sending the message that the nations involved were not safe places for visitors. The resulting insecurity restructured the region as susceptible and threatening. This led to a marked reduction in tourist arrivals and revenues, and as a consequence, job losses. Since then, lack of employment in the hospitality sector in Middle East region continues to be a big problem. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the theories of branding image and training, and as such, explore the concepts of branding, hotel culture, orientation and coaching among hotel employees in Northern Cyprus. The questionnaires for the study were distributed to the five-star hotels in Northern Cyprus. The PLS software was used in the analysis of the questionnaires and the study concluded that branding indeed affects hotel culture, coaching and orientation. The study also reached a number of recommendations including aligning the experiences of employees with brand promises, striving to adopt brand-specific leadership conducts, treating employees well and establishing formal systems.

Media and learning democracy: The face of emerging political activism in Egypt,2018,"Popular protests erupted in Egypt at the start of the second decade of the twentyfirst century, inspired by similar uprisings in the Arab world. The formation of political parties following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak allowed a variety of Islamist actors to enter the political field with relative ease. Youth activists and groups employed bottom-up activism in a process that Larbi Sadiki has described to be ‘democratic learning’. In this article, I will explore the process through which Egyptian political actors, from an Islamist background, learnt democracy in a local context. Democracy is understood here in a decentred fashion: It is not necessarily tied to the institutional structures of the modern state. I shall examine Hizb al-Tayyar al-Masry (Egyptian Current Party) between 2011 and 2013 supplemented by other displays of democratic collective agency in the examples of Hizb Misr al-Qawiyya (Strong Egyptian Party) and al-Thawra Mustamirra (The Revolution Continues) alliance. I will explore how the forms of media practices deployed by activists were a key component of a broader revolutionary strategy of civic mobilization.

"Evolving role of North African civil society actors in the foreign policymaking process: youth, women’s, labour and human rights organisations",2019,"This article examines the evolving foreign policy roles of four sets of civil society actors–youth, women’s, labour and human rights groups–in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia during the Arab Spring and beyond. Our findings demonstrate that civil society groups initially flourished in the Arab Spring, with the region’s average ‘civil society rights score’ registering positive increases in 2011 and 2012. The period of 2013 to 2018 witnessed a deterioration in this average score, as civil society faced an authoritarian backlash from illiberal (authoritarian) and liberal (democratic) North African regimes. An examination of individual civil society organisations further demonstrates a range of influence on foreign policy. Youth groups exert the least impact on North African foreign policies, despite high expectations associated with their central role in revolutionary protests and change associated with the Arab Spring. In contrast, women’s, labour and especially human rights organisations have played more influential if still limited foreign policy roles. Finally, the impact of civil society on foreign policy is strongly mediated by a country’s level of democracy. Only in Tunisia, which made a successful transition to democracy, have civil society organisations in the post-Arab Spring continuously enjoyed the freedoms to organise, protest and provide input into policy, including foreign policy.

Arab Spring Era: Winds of Change in the Direction of Gender Equality for Tunisian Women,2018,"This study asks a simple question: Has there been any upgrading in the status of women in Tunisia in the years following the Jasmine Revolution of December 2010? Based upon a comparative analysis of the Tunisian constitutions of 1959 and 2014, this paper argues that Tunisian women have, in fact, experienced a real change in their status within Tunisian society. Through a combination of their strong collective identity and a self-initiated process of political opportunity, the popular protest in Tunisia led to legislative changes which were supported by the long history of women’s presence in the Tunisian social-public sphere, together with helpful secular-oriented political forces. The new constitution of 2014 took steps to attain real gender equality in Tunisia; several Tunisian laws have been changed in favor of women since 2014 as well. The implementation of gender equality has, however, still been too slow and faces obstacles, mainly from Islamist groups — including Salafis who have been exerting pressure to impose a religious character on Tunisian society based upon the Shari‘a.

Popular politics in the Medieval Middle East,2018,"Premodern Middle Eastern regimes were in general despotic, yet various social groups and communities did take part in the politics of their societies. Incidents of urban protest in Egypt and Syria in the late Mamluk period allow us to see some of their politics in practice, to understand some of the dynamics that operated in medieval Middle Eastern cities and the alliances between various groups and the social and political transformations that were taking place from the 15th century onwards. Recent research has added more nuance to understanding urban protest, not simply as reflexive reactions to economic strife but more as part of the dynamic that maintained city life and integrated various communities and which reflected new ideas of shared values and expectations of power. In riots, crowds of common people allied with and protested against military elites, religious scholars, merchants, and craftsmen. Recent studies have highlighted various roles of non-elite urban groups in politics, analyzed urban politics in a regional and global context, and revised assumptions about unchanging autocratic Middle Eastern political culture. Some attention has also been given to the roles of peasants in rural politics. Studying popular politics allows us a better understanding of the role of various communities in pre-modern Middle Eastern history.

Aspiring to the ‘gatekeeper role’ in the realm of foreign policy? The North African Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Arab Spring era,2019,"This article explores the evolving foreign policy roles played by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, by drawing on a unique data set of diplomatic data, interviews and field research, and a small, largely case study-oriented literature. The results demonstrate that North Africa is unique as a region due to the fact that all five North African countries maintain ‘high’ levels of diplomatic representation (i.e. more than forty-five embassies maintained abroad), and that these embassy networks have grown and diversified throughout the contemporary independence era, including during the Arab Spring. This is principally due to economic power and cultural history; neither a country’s size, regime type, nor transition to democracy appear to matter. Second, the foreign policy role played by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs throughout North Africa has ebbed and flowed during the last sixty-seven years (1951–2018), including during the Arab Spring. The evolution of foreign policy influence is the result of a number of factors, including regime type, the stability (i.e. turn-over rate) of the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the rise and decline of other government institutions and especially other bureaucracies. Of particular importance is the relationship of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the economic affairs bureaucracies, the Ministry of Defense and the military establishment more broadly, and the assumption of power by moderate Islamist parties.

Revolutionary diplomats? Introduction to the study of North African foreign policies within the context of the Arab Spring,2019,"This article explores the concept of ‘revolutionary diplomats’ that is central to this guest-edited issue of The Journal of North African Studies. Specifically, we explore whether the political openings associated with the Arab Spring beginning in January 2011 have permitted the emergence and/or re-emergence of state and non-state actors that are capable of challenging the foreign policy supremacy of authoritarian presidents, and therefore playing more important roles in the formulation and implementation of their countries’ foreign policies. We do so by focusing on the North African countries of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. The first part of this article explores North Africa’s status within the Arab Spring and broader Foreign Policy Analysis literatures, most notably the foreign policy shortcomings associated with an inherently case study approach that dominates these literatures. A second section examines three theoretical approaches (‘big man’, great power, and dependency theories) that typically have been adopted to explain North African foreign policies. The primary dilemma with these theories is that they limit our understanding of North African foreign policies to either North African rulers or external powers. A third section sets out a domestic actor approach to North African foreign policy, which underscores that a host of state actors (such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and non-state actors (such as civil society groups) play varied foreign policy roles. The foreign policy influence of these actors has ebbed and flowed during democratic and authoritarian periods alike, including during the Arab Spring. ","Revolutionary diplomats?

Use of sports media to crack down on the 2011 Bahraini uprising,2018,"This study explores the relationship between sports media and politics in Bahrain when Bahrainis took to the streets in the 2011 uprising. It addresses two questions: how did the pro-regime sports media frame the uprising in Bahrain and what strategies were used by the Al-Khalifa regime to politicize the sports media? A quantitative and qualitative content analysis was conducted of the sports media coverage in two television sports programmes in the period between March and May 2011 when demonstrations spread across Bahrain, sports activities were suspended and martial law was introduced. This study concludes that the sports media was used as a propaganda tool by the Al-Khalifa regime in Bahrain to carry out repressive actions on behalf of the nation, to name and shame the protesters, and to preserve the status quo.

Remote assessments of the archaeological heritage situation in Afghanistan,2018,"Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns in looting and destruction at archaeological sites using satellite imagery has become a focus of multiple research groups working on cultural heritage in conflict zones, especially in areas controlled by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. In this paper, we apply similar methods to investigate looting and destruction at archaeological sites in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, where Taliban-related cultural heritage destruction events have also frequently made international headlines. Using the time depth provided by high-resolution, time-stamped DigitalGlobe satellite and BuckEye aerial images as well as CORONA and other historical satellite images and maps, we quantitatively document spatial and temporal patterns in destruction from looting, agricultural activity, military occupation, urban growth, mining, and other kinds of development at over 1000 previously known archaeological sites across Afghanistan. This analysis indicates that several common narratives about cultural heritage destruction in Afghanistan may require revision. Specifically, we conclude that significant amounts of systematic looting of archaeological sites in Afghanistan already occurred before Taliban-related conflicts, that there has been little increase in systematic looting in Taliban-controlled areas post-2001, and that the most pressing threats to Afghanistan's heritage sites come from development activities, including agricultural expansion, urban growth, and future mining. The analysis demonstrates that the situation in Afghanistan both parallels and contrasts with that seen in the post-Arab-Spring Middle East.

Arab Spring future challenges: evidence from Egypt,2018,"Purpose: This paper aims to shed light on the Egyptian socio-economic and political conditions seven years post the 2011 revolution. Design/methodology/approach: The authors depended on secondary data and information gathered from scholars and from domestic and international institutions as well. Additionally, the authors distributed 390 Likert-scale questionnaires among respondents to test their perceptions regarding the safety, social, political and economic conditions in Egypt seven years post the 2011 revolution. Findings: The research findings confirmed that there was an agreement among participants that the safety conditions in Egypt improved during the past seven years post the 2011 revolution, and there was a general agreement among participants that the political conditions in Egypt became more stable lately. The economic and social cost presents a challenging status to the current decision maker. Practical implications: Finally, authors came up with recommendations aiming to find solutions for certain economic and political problematic issues. The main research limitation is that the representative sample was confined only to the two main governorates in Egypt: Cairo and Giza. Originality/value: Finally, the study is of a value, as it could be considered a road map to policy makers. Moreover, the findings provide a set of policies for governments to undertake tenable actions to accelerate development and economic growth.

It concludes that the EU’s failure to discipline either country’s competitive authoritarian regime raises important questions about the validity of the privileged role in which they cast Europe.

Trauma as counter-revolutionary colonisation: Narratives from (post)revolutionary Egypt,2018,"We argue that multiple levels of trauma were present in Egypt before, during and after the 2011 revolution. Individual, social and political trauma constitute a triangle of traumatisation which was strategically employed by the Egyptian counter-revolutionary forces – primarily the army and the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood – to maintain their political and economic power over and above the social, economic and political interests of others. Through the destruction of physical bodies, the fragmentation and polarisation of social relations and the violent closure of the newly emerged political public sphere, these actors actively repressed the potential for creative and revolutionary transformation. To better understand this multi-layered notion of trauma, we turn to Habermas’ ‘colonisation of the lifeworld’ thesis which offers a critical lens through which to examine the wider political and economic structures and context in which trauma occurred as well as its effects on the personal, social and political realms. In doing so, we develop a novel conception of trauma that acknowledges individual, social and political dimensions. We apply this conceptual framing to empirical narratives of trauma in Egypt’s pre- and post-revolutionary phases, thus both developing a non-Western application of Habermas’ framework and revealing ethnographic accounts of the revolution by activists in Cairo.

Arabic Language Arts Standards: Revolution or Disruption?,2018,"Textbooks are major organizers of Arabic language instruction in most Arab countries (Faour, 2012). Textbooks approved by ministries of education have traditionally guided teaching of content knowledge, skills, and values to be taught at each grade level (Faour, 2012; Sabella, 2014; Taha-Thomure, 2008). This research is a foundation study into the use of Arabic Language Arts (ALA) standards in six schools in three countries in the Arabian Gulf region (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates). Fifty-eight teachers used the ALA standards adapted from the Ohio English Language Arts standards (Taha, 2017a) for at least one year. Results of the online survey indicated that 83.5% of teachers found the standards had a positive effect on their teaching, while 94.9% of teachers found that the standards helped them collaborate with each other in planning and finding suitable resources to use. This suggests that well-supported innovations can lead to teachers being aware of and using ALA to improve student learning and instruction. Results also highlight some of the challenges teachers faced to find the necessary Arab language resources that will help them implement a standards-based approach, in addition to the amount of time they needed to put into preparing for the lessons.

Military influence in foreign policy-making: changing dynamics in North African regimes,2019,"The strong political position armed forces enjoy in authoritarian states and the high priority military elites assign to foreign affairs would lead one to believe that in North Africa–a region made up of authoritarian states with the sole, recent, and partial exception of Tunisia–generals had the political standing to exert a major influence on foreign policy decisions. This would not be a correct assumption because in this region the armed forces’ political influence is actually highly variable. Of the five states analysed in this article (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia) the military is the dominant political institution only in Algeria and Egypt. In the other three countries, the army plays a marginal political role and, by extension, possesses modest foreign policy influence. Moreover, the political clout of these armies is not constant. Since the Arab Spring the political influence of Egyptian generals has considerably increased, that of their Tunisian colleagues has marginally risen, while the status of Libya’s military leaders has diminished.

Civic resilience during conflict: Syria’s local councils,2018,"With the ‘return of the state’ in Syria, Assad’s ‘resilience’ is a puzzle increasingly broached in both media and academic discourses.

Appeals soliciting global support for an uprising seeking freedom and dignity give way to lamentations over disappointed yet tenacious Syrian aspirations. The article then explores Syrian ‘democratic learning’ through a mini-case study of opposition-controlled local councils. Drawing on original interview data, it argues that these councils exhibit ‘civic resilience’ as they navigate and adopt international norms discourses to protest and resist not just Assad but also international actors, and gradually take up democratic processes including elections.

The Coptic christian minority in contemporary Egypt since the Arab spring,2018,"Despite their participation as citizens and patriots in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Coptic Christians were subjected to mob violence and other hostile acts after Mubarak’s fall. Their situation further deteriorated under the short-lived presidency of Mohammad Morsi and during the chaotic period that followed his ouster by the military in July 2013. The continuation of sectarian hatred, discriminatory behavior, and anti-Christian violence under the current President, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, demonstrates that he has not taken sufficient action to confront violent Islamism and promote tolerance toward the country’s Christian minority. More needs to be done to protect non-Muslims from terrorism and extremism.

Assessing rangeland cover conversion in Jordan after the Arab spring using a remote sensing approach,2018,"The influence of population growth and Syrian refugee settlements on rangeland degradation in Jordan using remotely-sensed data was assessed. Eleven cloud-free Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Images that cover the study area were used. Maximum likelihood classifier was applied to estimate rangeland, cropland, urban, water and forest cover percentages over the study area for the period 2013–2015. Change detection analysis of both 2013 and 2015 images revealed a dramatic expansion of urban lands and a consequent reduction in rangelands, especially in north-western Jordan. Our analysis suggests that Jordanian rangeland area decreased by 9.6%, forests by 1.5% and water by 0.6% during the study period (2013–2015). Meanwhile, urban lands increased by 11.4% and croplands by 0.2%. We attributed this change mainly to Syrian civil war and refugee settlements. This settlement process increased the demand for food and water and accelerated desertification processes in Jordanian rangelands, especially those in the north-western region. Our study underscores the value of using remotely sensed data as a viable approach to quantify degradation in Middle Eastern rangelands. Overall, we suggest initiating rigorous urban settlement regulations and land conservation control programs to mitigate land degradation in Jordanian rangelands.

Hopeful City: Meritocracy and Affect in Global Cairo,2018,"Contemporary forms of ‘world-class’ or ‘global’ city making have displaced, excluded and imperilled millions of urban inhabitants across the global South. This article departs from conventional approaches in urban geography to understanding the relationship ‘global cities’ forge with those inhabitants, which focus on the displacement, resistance and inventive survival of the poor within the ‘informal city’. Instead, it highlights more interstitial and less combative experiences. First, it explicates the presence of a group of Egyptians stripped of their ability to forge a middle-class life in the context of Cairo's ‘global city’ project. Thereafter, rather than focusing on their propensity to engage in political mobilization—a dominant trend after Egypt's 2011 Uprising—the article utilizes 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork to argue that Cairo's ‘global’ city offers up a semblance of inclusion to this excluded group. By extending a meritocratic promise that ‘global’ belonging is achievable through hard work, it keeps aspirational young men attached to a feeling of hope. The article therefore shows not how ‘global’ or ‘world-class’ urban projects induce the resistance of wider urban populations, but how they secure legitimacy.

In this article I argue that this misinformed, partial, and superficial depiction of the protests, centered around hip hop and social media, has strategically shaped the ways in which the uprisings have been framed within the American public imaginary, attempted to control the direction and outcome of the uprisings in the streets, and further served to impose a neo-Orientalist discourse of American hegemony over forces of reform and democratization in the Arab Middle East.

"The evolving impact of violent non-state actors on North African foreign policies during the Arab Spring: insurgent groups, terrorists and foreign fighters",2019,"This article explores the evolving foreign policy influence of three violent non-state actors–insurgent groups, terrorist organisations and foreign fighters–in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia during the Arab Spring and beyond. It draws on a unique dataset (1970–2015) compiled by the authors to explore whether countries or geographical regions experiencing various forms of political unrest, such as North Africa during the Arab Spring, exhibit greater levels of violence by violent non-state actors. North African leaders have responded to this violence by making the pursuit of national security their primary foreign policy goal. This response has led to the marginalisation of other expected benefits of the Arab Spring, including socio-economic development, human rights reforms and democratisation. North African leaders–old and new alike–have instead coordinated with regional and international partners in the pursuit of common national security-oriented foreign policy objectives, most notably counterterrorism.

Egypt’s Political Actors Post-2011 Revolution: Incomplete Struggle for Democracy,2018,"Considering historical developments, this article discusses the conditions that have impeded Egypt’s political actors to lead a democratic transition following the 2011 revolution. In this context, I argue that the failure of Egypt’s major political actors to effect a democratic transition post-2011 revolution is largely due to the obstruction of Egypt’s actors before the revolution. This argument is based on a historical assessment of Egypt’s political actors’ development and engagement in opposition activities over two periods: post-1952 military coup and post-2011 revolution. The article suggests that a democratic transition in post-revolution countries like Egypt, which did not achieve a decisive victory over authoritarianism, requires strong prodemocracy actors to face antidemocracy actors and lead a democratization process.

Winners and losers in the Arab uprisings: a Mediterranean tourism perspective,2018,"This paper analyses the effects of the recent Arab uprisings on tourism destinations located along the Mediterranean coastline. It uses time-series analysis to model international tourist arrivals. First, autoregressive integrated moving average models are estimated for the period 1980–2009 and predicted for 2010–2014 to establish suitable country controls. Second, Bayesian structural time-series models – designed primarily to determine causal impacts in on-line marketing campaigns – are used to establish the effects of the events in Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Turkey, Spain and Greece. The main conclusion is that the models clearly capture the negative impact of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and their positive impacts on Morocco and Turkey. However, the effects on Spain and Greece are less clear and depend crucially on the set of controls used in the analysis.

The destruction of cultural heritage and international tourism: The case of the Arab countries,2018,"World Heritage Sites (WHS) are in danger in some Arab countries that have suffered from conflict since the Arab Spring. Many countries base their development strategies on promoting cultural tourism by making use of their rich historical and artistic heritage. However, the literature has not clarified the benefit of having the nominations that UNESCO grants to the places that house such valuable cultural patrimony. Therefore, the impact of the loss of this heritage is also unclear. In this paper we estimate the economic loss that would result from total or partial damage to WHS. Our results indicate that WHS are a major cause of influx of tourists, especially to the Arab countries that are currently at risk of conflict. Our analysis finds that the disappearance of those sites classified as “in danger” by UNESCO would cause a minimum loss of around 12% of their tourism, with Libya and Syria being the most affected countries.

Moral Identity and Protest Cascades in Syria,2018,"Cascade models explain the roles of the intrepid few who initiate protest and the masses who join when the expected utility of dissent flips from negative to positive. Yet questions remain about what motivates participation between those points on the causal chain, or under any conditions of high risk. To explain these anomalies, this article employs theories of moral identity to explore the interdependence of a facet of decision making that rationalist models typically regard as fixed: individuals' awareness of and need to express values central to their sense of self. Three mechanisms describe ways that individuals' responses to early risers trigger moral identity-based motivations for protest. First, by conjuring normative ideals, first movers can activate bystanders' urge to follow their example in order to earn their own self-respect. Secondly, by demonstrating the joy of agency, early risers can inspire bystanders' desire to experience the same gratification. Thirdly, by absorbing punishments, early risers can activate onlookers' sense of moral obligation to contribute to collective efforts. These mechanisms redouble bystanders' sense of the inherent value of protest, apart from its instrumental utility, and intensify their acceptance of risks, independent of the actual risks anticipated. Original interviews with displaced Syrians about their participation in demonstrations illustrate these processes.

The Orthodox issue in Jordan: The struggle for an Arab and Orthodox Identity,2018,"Scholarship on Christians in the Middle East has paid little attention to the role the Christian laity has played in defining and maintaining Christian identity and community boundaries. The so-called Orthodox issue (al-qadya al-urthudhuksiyya in Arabic) enhances our understanding of this role. It is an ongoing conflict within the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem between the church leadership of Greek extraction and the Arab - usually lower-ranking - clergy and laity. This article uses a case-study approach to a series of protests in Jordan in 2014 against a decision by the Patriarchate to relocate a local reform-minded cleric. Using ethnographic, historical and philological methods, I argue that through their engagement in this struggle, Greek Orthodox Jordanians assert their identity as Christians, as Arabs and as loyal Jordanians.

Although young people appreciate new-found freedoms of expression and association in post-Arab Spring Tunisia, the economy, acquiescent to the neoliberal model and weighed down with corruption and political marginalization, has deprived many of a dignified existence. The research reported in this paper surveys over 100 youth chosen from northern, coastal, central and southern parts of Tunisia. It examines how Tunisian youth view the Arab Spring in the context of unstable socio-economic and political environments. To most surveyed youths, the Arab Spring is a failure in socio-economic terms, but it is also an occasion to reassert their Tunisian identity.

"The Dimensionality, Type, and Structure of Political Ideology on the Political Party Level in the Arab World",2018,"Purpose: The aim of this research is to uncover the dimensionality of political ideology on the political parties’ level in the Arab World. It tests the polarization thesis claiming that Arab politics is driven by a uni-dimensional political conflict between Islamists and Secularists. This research empirically assesses whether the church versus state cleavage has been the dominant political conflict in the region following the Arab Spring. Methods: This research utilizes quantitative content analyses of party manifestos in order to construct a new data set for measuring party positions in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco on thirty politically relevant issues. From this data, multi-dimensional scaling is applied, generating a graphical configuration of the dimensionality, type, and structuration of political ideology on the party level in the Middle East. Results: Findings indicate that political ideology on the party level in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco is multi-dimensional. Two broad statistically independent dimensions, political economic and cultural, organize party positions in the immediate elections following the Arab Spring. This finding does not lend support to the polarization thesis claiming that the conflict over the role of Islam is the only and main component driving electoral competition in the region. Conclusions: This research contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the dimensionality of political ideology. It demonstrates that the dominant and simplistic uni-dimensional model is insufficient in describing real political content in Western, as well as non-Western, contexts. Further, this study concludes that Islam is no longer the dominant topic of political parties across the Middle East. On the contrary, issues of pure economics, political administration, democracy, and welfare dominate the political discourse in the region. Findings of this study open new horizons to the development of more refined empirical analyses in the study of ideology in the Middle East.

Why students engage in cyber-cheating through a collective movement: A case of deviance and collusion,2018,"The use of social networking sites (SNS) such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube has contributed to improving teaching and learning in contemporary educational systems. Unfortunately, online social networks are among the many emerging technology artefacts that introduce new and potentially serious risks to academic environments and therefore have also been credited with the increased prevalence of academic cheating, or cyber-cheating, among students. Recent media attention has focused on how social media has added another medium that can facilitate many collective movements, such as recent uprisings in the Arab world. However, limited research focus has been afforded to the role SNS plays in the pervasiveness of cheating in non-Western cultural settings. Given the continuing growth in social media and advanced technologies, it is necessary to explore and understand academic cheating in the era of digital technology and cultural complexity. In this research, we conduct a case study of ‘Tasribat’, a Facebook page that facilitates cyber-cheating among certain social groups of students in Morocco. Using an interpretive case study approach, we explore why students collectively engage in cyber-cheating. We leverage both interviews as well digital footprints to explore this collective cheating movement on Facebook. We focus on the intertwined relationship between individual and collective cyber-cheating behaviours with an emphasis on ethical and cultural complexity. The paper's major contribution resides in its analysis and conceptualisation through our emerging model—the Collective Action Cyber-Cheating Model—that integrates collective action and social learning theories. We conclude by discussing this study's contributions to research and practice and its associated future research opportunities.

"Feeling so hood. rap, lifestyles and the neighbourhood imaginary in Tunisia",2019,"The article examines the role of rap in reimagining the social structure in Tunisia after its 2010/2011 revolution. Before the revolution, the Ben Ali regime imposed a narrative of Tunisian society as mainly middle class; beneath this narrative, the Tunisian folklore hosted multiple markers of social distinction that classified people through their perceived lifestyles: residence, language habits, consumption patterns, religious attitudes. Disadvantaged neighbourhoods were obliterated by the official narrative and condemned to social spite by the unofficial ones. After the revolution, the success of rap came to ‘represent’ those quarters and the youth that inhabited them: rappers sang the hoods by criticizing their hard conditions and, at the same time, glorifying the hoods themselves. The vagueness of the social narratives in the country allowed rap musicians to manipulate both the image of the poor neighbourhoods and the idioms of social difference circulating in Tunisia: through this manipulation, they provided a new dignity to the most marginalized sectors of Tunisian society. At the same time, by representing the hoods, rappers could claim social capital and credibility as the ‘true’ narrators of the new Tunisia. But the reimagination of social narratives was not enough to improve the life conditions of dispossessed youth.

Political change and informality: Evidence from the Arab Spring,2019,"This paper examines informality during the political and economic turmoil that accompanied the Arab Spring revolution in Egypt. The paper focuses on unprotected employment and the extent to which it changed by educational level immediately after the January Uprising of 2011. We find that over time and particularly after the revolution, informal employment has increased for both high- and low-educated workers, albeit through different paths: high-educated workers were more likely to be stuck in informality, while low-educated formal workers were more likely to lose their contracts. The increase in informal employment in the wake of the Arab Spring is more pronounced for the high-educated. The results suggest a high level of rigidity in the Egyptian labour market, even in the wake of the Arab Spring.

Differentiation and diffusion: shifting public opinion attitudes toward foreign policy in North Africa,2019,"Drawing on Arab Barometer data, this article provides the backdrop for understanding continuity and change since the Arab Spring in national-level public opinion attitudes toward economic and political foreign policy issues in North Africa, inclusive of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. The article leverages the concepts of differentiation and diffusion to understand how international affairs shape public opinion in North Africa since the Arab Spring. Three findings emerge. First, public opinion about domestic and international issues are linked in the minds of North African citizens and foreign policy issues are more important factors underlying pre- and post-Arab Spring politics than are often recognised. Especially in the post-Arab Spring era, Arab citizens widely see external interference as a problem and this perception increased in every North African country between 2013 and 2016. Moreover, there is considerable variation across and within North African states in attitudes toward economic and political foreign policy issues, including the Arab-Israeli conflict and attitudes about economic and security relationships with Israel. Anti-Israeli sentiment increased substantially in the years leading up to and following the Arab Spring. Finally, since the Arab Spring, anti-Americanism, as measured by negative perceptions of U.S. culture, has declined in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, but risen slightly in Egypt, even as North Africans demonstrate increased support for a U.S. role in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict during this same time period. These trends suggest that anti-Americanism is highly dependent on specific domestic and international developments and is highly complex in the Arab world.

Moreover, there is considerable variation across and within North African states in attitudes toward economic and political foreign policy issues, including the Arab-Israeli conflict and attitudes about economic and security relationships with Israel. Anti-Israeli sentiment increased substantially in the years leading up to and following the Arab Spring. Finally, since the Arab Spring, anti-Americanism, as measured by negative perceptions of U.S. culture, has declined in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, but risen slightly in Egypt, even as North Africans demonstrate increased support for a U.S. role in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict during this same time period. These trends suggest that anti-Americanism is highly dependent on specific domestic and international developments and is highly complex in the Arab world.

Democratisation and the evolution of the foreign policy content of North African constitutions,2019,"The unprecedented wave of constitutional reforms in North Africa in the wake of the Arab Spring provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the foreign policy content of constitutions in different political contexts. Using a cross-national statistical analysis of 195 national constitutions promulgated from 1974 to 2015, as well as an in-depth analysis of North African constitutional reforms from 2011 to 2016, this study finds that compared to dictatorships, democracies allocate less power to the executive in the realm of foreign policy. A comparison of the revised North African constitutions with their pre-Arab Spring predecessors also shows that while the foreign policy content of the Algerian and Moroccan constitutions did not change significantly, constitutional provisions in Tunisia and Egypt successfully limited executive power regarding foreign affairs.

Doomed to be Dammed? Analyzing the Different Outcomes of Three South American Megadams,2018,"Hydroelectric dams are one of the cleanest, cheapest, and most efficient sources of energy in the world. However, megadams (those greater than 2,000 megawatts in production capacity) can incite substantial sociopolitical and environmental opposition because they displace people, animals, trees, and sediments. Despite heated disagreements surrounding all megadam construction, what factors increase the likelihood for some to be constructed while others are canceled? The purpose of this analysis is to illuminate those factors that shape these different outcomes using a most-similar case design. It compares three megadams in South America: the Madeira project in Brazil, which was built; and the Inambari project in Peru and the HydroAysén project in Chile, both of which were canceled. The study finds that the diversity of protesters, unification of the social movement, domestic media coverage, and the sitting president’s popularity are all important factors that affect whether a megadam project is constructed. The findings from this article offer insights that both proponents and opponents of megadams need to closely consider.

Islamist parties and foreign policy in North Africa: bridging ideology and pragmatism,2019,"Islamist political parties rose to lead governments in three North African countries after the 2010–11 Arab Spring: Ennahda in Tunisia, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) in Morocco, and the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in Egypt. While sharing many similarities with non-Islamist parties, these parties brought unique ideological and identity preferences to both domestic and foreign policy. With respect to foreign policy, these included a preference for strengthening foreign relationships within the Islamic world, a preference for indigenous solutions over ‘colonial’ ones, and a willingness to fight for ‘just causes’ at the expense of strategic relationships or traditional alliances. These preferences were significantly constrained in practice, however, leading Islamist parties to pursue much more traditional foreign policies than some had initially projected. The foreign policy pursued by governing Islamist parties resulted from a mixture of ideological preferences and institutional constraints. These constraints emerged from the domestic institutional context faced by ruling parties (such as governing coalitions and hybrid regimes), from international pressures, and also from a path to election that created internal party norms that favoured the status quo. As illustrated by three North African cases, Islamist parties in government must inevitably walk the line between ideology and pragmatism as they try to translate the ideals that served them well in political opposition to the realities of the global stage.

Marginalizing Revolutionaries in Egypt’s Civil State Debate,2018,"After President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown on February 11, 2011, competing narratives emerged about the Egyptian civil state during the formulation of the 2012 and 2014 constitutions.

Law and Social Change in Tunisia: The Case of Unregistered Marriage,2018,"In the aftermath of the 'Arab Spring', Tunisian media reported a practice of so-called 'urfi, or unregistered, marriages among university students. For Tunisian women's rights activists, the phenomenon was the result of Salafi influence that had been able to enter Tunisian legal practice after the fall of the authoritarian regime in 2011. For these activists, the Tunisian law on marriage registration had initially been able to change social practices through the introduction of civil marriage upon independence and was currently overturned under Salafi influence. Against the background of the recent Tunisian debate, this article examines the application of the law on marriage registration by judges and lay people between independence and 2011 in order to understand to what extent this law was indeed effective in bringing about social change in the field of marriage registration.

What are, considering the particular social and political context in the field, the potential risks for interviewees and the researcher, and what can be done to eliminate or at least mitigate these risks? Reflecting on extensive fieldwork on the role of the prodemocracy movement during the Egyptian Uprising of 2011 in the wake of the so-called ‘Arab Spring,’ this study illustrates how rather abstract ethical considerations can be handled practically in an environment that is characterized by increasing levels of political repression and decreasing civil liberties. It is in such contexts that a failure to carefully consider such ethical questions entails a very real risk of endangering the livelihoods and even lives of research participants. Furthermore, it is shown that these and similar issues are not only of critical importance when designing a research project, but that they might have to be revisited and renegotiated at later stages of the research process – even after the conclusion of the data collection phase. Here, questions of data protection, anonymity of informants, and the associated ‘do no harm’ principle are particularly pertinent.

Cleansing the caliphate: Insurgent violence against sexual minorities,2018,"Why do insurgents target certain groups for extermination? Despite a great deal of attention to the targeting of civilian ethnic minorities, comparatively little scholarship exists on insurgent violence against sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transsexual individuals). This article maintains that the decision to target sexual minorities follows three distinct logics: two strategic and one ideological. First, insurgents face an incentive to outbid rivals by targeting sexual minorities when homophobic violence is politically and socially legitimated. Second, territorial control creates an incentive for insurgents to signal their ability to selectively punish, which they can accomplish through homophobic violence. Third, revolutionary ideologies provide legitimation for exclusionary violence in the pursuit of transforming society. Statistical analysis of insurgent violence against sexual minorities from 1985 to 2015 lends strong support for these arguments. Process tracing of the spread of violence against sexual minorities in Iraq and Syria clarifies the strategic causal mechanisms. When progovernment militias targeted perceived homosexuals with impunity, antigay violence was adopted by insurgent groups seeking to legitimize their claims to power; violence then quickly spread to competing insurgents. Two additional cases from Latin America demonstrate that ideology plays an important role in influencing which groups embrace homophobic violence even under these strategic constraints.

Towards a new perspective on the role of the city in social movements: Urban Policy after the ‘Arab Spring’,2018,"Cities were at the centre of the ‘Arab Spring’, but did they play a decisive role or were they just the passive settings in which these uprisings took place? This paper develops a new way of understanding the role of the city in social movements by looking at changes and continuities in urban policy in North Africa after the ‘Arab Spring’. The paper’s main argument is that the role of the city in social movements can be understood through an analysis of governments’ urban policy responses to those movements. First, it shows that North African urban policy has always reacted sensitively to social unrest and that neoliberal planning schemes have even strengthened this sensitivity. Second, the paper provides an empirical comparative analysis of urban policy in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia after the ‘Arab Spring’. The study shows that public authorities give pivotal attention to public space and to informal settlements as they have been stigmatised as breeding grounds of social unrest and as a threat to the political establishment.

The quest for regional legitimation: Analyzing the Arab League’s legitimizing role in the Arab spring,2018,"The topic of international legitimacy has returned to centre stage during the Arab Spring, in which the Arab League has apparently assumed a prominent legitimation role. Although some scholarship has studied how international organizations are decisive in legitimizing actors and their actions during conflicts, relatively scant attention has been focused at constructing a comprehensive analytical framework for this kind of assessment that could be also applied to regional organizations (ROs). This paper proposes that when actors are involved in battles over international legitimation, analysing their access to the socially identified brokers of three legitimation functions (appropriateness, consensus, and empathy) is key to assess their success. Particularly, we argue that relevant identity-based ROs may have a crucial legitimizing role by operating as brokers of regional consensus. For this purpose, two case studies–Bahrain and Libya–illustrate how the Arab League’s brokerage influenced the legitimation of the actors involved and their outcomes. The findings suggest novel implications about the decisive legitimizing impact of regionalism on conflict resolution.

Understating the logic of regime survival? Conceptualizing state–society relations and parliamentary liberation in post-2011 Jordan,2018,"Both reform and revolutionary movements in the Arab world have called on institutions of state to follow through on the cries for dignity, bread and social justice emanating from the street. These movements are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and may demonstrate overlapping commonalities of practice. Asef Bayat has designated this phenomenon an example of ‘refo-lution’, the amalgamation of a revolutionary agenda with a reform process. This paper will argue that 2011/2012 demonstrations in Jordan fall into this category, and that they elucidate that the relationship between the Hashemite monarchy and Jordanian society needs to be reframed for political stability. The theoretical frame of this article, grounded in the selectorate theory of Bruce Bueno de Mesquita in conjunction with insights from Nazih Ayubi, suggests that this stability requires a more defined separation of powers and functions of the monarchy and the parliament, making the latter an autonomous legislative body.

Reducing barriers how the Jews of Djerba are using tourism to assert their place in the modern nation state of Tunisia,2018,"The Island of Djerba is one of Tunisia’s most important tourist venues. Once a year, it becomes the host site for the only Jewish pilgrimage in the entire Islamic world, an event that takes place at the synagogue of El Ghriba, itself the oldest synagogue in North Africa. The Jewish community in Djerba is today confronted not only by the challenges of declining numbers due to outmigration and an aging population, but also by issues arising from a lack of political representation. The result has been a rise in forecasts about a continued decline in community numbers and a corresponding attrition in the number of people making the pilgrimage to El Ghriba. At the same time, with the increase in Jihadist threats since the attack against the synagogue in 2002 and the revolution of 2011, the importance of ensuring that the pilgrimage to El Ghriba can continue to occur has become an issue of national concern. The pilgrimage is now launched every year under the auspices of officials of the State, such as President Marzouki and and different Ministers of Tourism and takes place under heavy military and police protection. Both the pilgrimage itself and the community now seem to be invested with a new role intrinsic to the overall economic and security status of the country. This article proposes an analysis of the different strategies employed by the Jewish community to use tourism to reassert its role as a full and active citizen of Tunisia, while at the same time maintaining the vitality of the pilgrimage to El Ghriba.

Conceptually, the article critically engages anthropologist Laura Bear’s suggestion that an ethics of productivity saturate neoliberal masculinity. As my ethnographic stories about football coaches and state bureaucrats illustrate, being a good man recurrently surfaced as a problem of how to work productively in and on time: as ambiguities between discordant futures that left material needs, familiar care, and development of football talents difficult to reconcile. Often, my interlocutors linked this conundrum to a wide-ranging opacity, conjured as “corruption” (fisad). My analysis of this male predicament allows me to spotlight one of the Egyptian revolution’s most luring promises: a transparent and meritocratic system, where a man’s work would finally be allowed to work on all futures deemed morally and materially significant.

"Egypt’s watchdogs: Citizen journalism before, during and after the 2011 revolution",2018,"Often, social perspectives of the Arab Revolution give a lot of credit to Facebook as the primary catalyst for political mobilization and citizen journalism. Although Facebook as a platform can be acclaimed for helping to shape this situation, this research argues that the role of Facebook is often exaggerated. In the context of this work, the ‘Arab Revolution’ refers to the period in which former President, Hosni Mubarak, was ousted from power in January 2011 and the term ‘revolution’ is not used to signal a radical transformation of society. Empirically, this article addresses the role of social media and in particular, Facebook, before, during and after this revolution. It examines the impact of this new technology on the rise of online social activism by investigating the effect of citizen journalism on forming public opinion, exploring the relationship between citizen journalism and the acceleration of the events that led to the Egyptian revolution. It also explores the impact of social media on citizen activism after the fall of Mubarak’s regime. In this case citizen journalism refers to the production of media content with the aim of changing public opinion. Empirical data for this research work were both qualitative and quantitative. Four hundred survey questionnaires were distributed to Facebook users to identify their usage before, during and after the 25 January Revolution to find out their views on social media activism and its impact on public opinion. The questionnaires covered the duration from June 2010 to June 2015. In addition, intensive interviews were conducted with media experts and political activists to gain a deeper insight of the role of citizen journalism in social change. Findings demonstrate that during the three stages of the Egyptian revolution, covered by this research, social media remained significant, albeit with a slight difference in its use by protesters. During the revolution, social media networks were primarily the outlets that Egyptians used to report local events to international media. The post revolution period has also witnessed an interest in social media networks. Facebook has made Egyptians more politically and socially conscious and encouraged them to participate in social and political events such as presidential and parliament elections. However, this research work reports that the use of such platforms does not seem to have had much impact on political change in Egypt during the last few years.

"United Nations and the Arab Spring: Role in Libya, Syria, and Yemen",2018,"The role of the United Nations (UN) in response to the developments in the Arab world should be viewed in the context of the larger trends of thought and action in the world organization in promoting democracy as a norm during the past nearly two decades. The norm of establishing accountability as against impunity has found wide acceptance to define the relationship between the rulers and the ruled in the new century. Against this background, the great expectations about the UN as a powerful transformational tool toward democratization had received a setback with tempering experiences in responding to developments in Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen since 2011. While the UN remained a bystander in Egypt in the wake of a coup against President Mohammed Morsi in 2013, it is striking that UN actions in Libya had cascading effect on its failure to act in Syria, which in turn produced a sense of fatigue in dealing with the situation in Yemen. In Libya’s case, the UN authorized military intervention did more harm than good to the cause of civilian protection and establishment of peaceful transition, but in Syria’s case, the military and political developments took place outside in the region and between major powers because of the diplomatic deadlock in the Security Council.

The accounting and financial data of these companies were obtained from their financial statements, whereas data on PCs of their officers and directors were collected manually from various sources. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were performed to test the hypothesis of this research. Findings: The results showed that PCs improve companies’ performance and value. These results could be explained, on the one hand, by the benefits and favors that companies can get from their political ties and, on the other hand, by investors’ tendency to invest in politically connected companies to benefit from these advantages. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of non-financial companies listed on the TSE is a limit for this research. Practical implications: The results show that investment in companies which are politically inter-connected may be beneficial for investors, and especially for small minority shareholders. Social implications: The results confirm that political links are essential for business success in emerging economies, such as Tunisia. However, the positive link between politics and business might highlight the issue of corruption after the revolution. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of PCs on the performance and value of Tunisian companies after the 2011 revolution.

Longitudinal determinants of married women’s autonomy in Egypt,2018,"This article explores determinants of women’s autonomy in Egypt around the beginning of the ‘Arab Spring’ in 2011. We show that women’s autonomy over time is a product not only of their individual characteristics, but also of the household and community environment in which they live. Using the 2006 and 2012 Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) and multilevel models, results demonstrate that women’s autonomy changes over time. There are large and consistent variations in women’s autonomy by household region of residence and wealth. For example, women in the rural and urban Upper Egypt region are less autonomous than women in the Cairo region, and women in wealthier households are less autonomous compared to the poorest households. Programs aiming to increase women’s autonomy focus exclusively or primarily on women’s own characteristics. These results indicate that strategies to improve women’s autonomy should be mindful of the multiple dimensions of autonomy and have a programmatic focus on changing household and social environments.

Diaries of Iraqi soldiers: Views from inside Saddam’s army,2018,"This article presents rarely seen glimpses into life in the barracks of the Iraqi Army during the Gulf War (1990–91). We analyse fifteen diaries of Iraqi soldiers found in the Kuwait Dataset of the Iraqi Ba’th Party Archives, which was first opened to researchers in July 2015. These diaries shed new light on the mind-sets, ideological frameworks, morale and daily lives of Iraqi rank-and-file soldiers. We ask the following questions: did Iraqi soldiers support the invasion and occupation of Kuwait and accept Saddam Hussein’s rationales for the war? How did Iraqi soldiers view the United States and its coalition partners? These diaries also provide clues about why so many retreating soldiers rose up against Saddam in country-wide protests one week after Iraq’s defeat in the war. Although diaries from the US Civil War and the First and Second World Wars have been thoroughly examined by historians and literary scholars, few diaries of soldiers from the modern Arab world have been studied. This article fills an important gap in knowledge about the experiences of soldiers in modern authoritarian regimes and about the Gulf War.

Abortive regime transition in Egypt: pro-democracy alliance and demand-making framework,2018,"What accounts for the failed transition and restructuring of authoritarianism in Egypt after a fleeting rupture in 2011? How did the dominant statist party lose its iron grip on power? Why did the collapse of the dominant party not bring about significant democratic transformation and generate power-sharing pacts? The article aims to go beyond the question of the importance of either authoritarian resilience or the transition paradigm to offer a two-layered analytical framework based on leverage level and the coherence of pro-democracy forces’ demands to account both for the timing of one-party collapse and the consequent dynamics of authoritarian revival. I allow room for complex and strategic interactions between different components of pro-democracy forces and the old ruling class to elucidate the contingent political trajectory after the time of disintegration. When pro-democracy forces maintained their leveraged position and kept a demand-claiming framework unified, they secured a ‘cooperative differentiation’ position and were able to apply consistent democratization pressure that led to regime breakdown. When they adopted a conformist stance and accommodated their demands to the incumbent regime, they became captive to the interests of old regime holdovers and asserted an ‘antagonistic identification’ position that hobbled efforts to move towards democratization.

Arab spring protests and women's labor market outcomes: Evidence from the Egyptian revolution,2018,"We analyze the effects of the 2011 Egyptian protests on the relative labor market conditions of women using panel data from the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS). Using unique information from the Statistical Database of the Egyptian Revolution, we geocode each “martyr” i.e. demonstrators who died during the protests, based on the location of the political incident. We construct our measure of the intensity of the protests – the district-level number of “martyrs” – and rely on a Difference-in-Differences approach. We find that the 2011 protests have reduced intra-household differences in labor force participation by increasing women's employment and unemployment relative to men. Women's employment relative to men increased in both the private and informal sectors. Our estimates suggest how economic uncertainty such as the one associated to the recent protests may undermine the importance of cultural factors and attitudes towards female work. We link these findings to the literature showing how a relevant shock to the labor division between women and men may have long run consequences on the role of women in society.

Shifting narratives of the police in Egyptian cinema before and after the January 2011 revolution,2018,"This article discusses shifting narratives of the police in Egyptian cinema before and after the 2011 revolution. It contextualises cinematic representations in a broad socio-historical framework that underlines the significance of the police and their enormous presence in citizens’ everyday lives in Egypt’s political history of state building. In the early years of the independent nation after the 1952 Free Officers’ coup, when the police was considered a ‘patriotic institution’ (mu’assassah wataniyya), Egyptian films showed policemen as heroes, who worked day and night to keep public safety, prevent crime and maintain order on the streets. But later, particularly during the three decades preceding the 2011 revolution, films began to show police brutality, torture methods in jails and prisons, and the corruption permeating the police apparatus in more explicit ways. The article considers thematic and technical ruptures as well as continuities between pre- and post-2011 representations of the police.

The voice and loyalty of business in Kuwait: Merchant politics in times of contention,2018,"According to the classic rentier state theory literature, the political activity of Kuwaiti merchants effectively ceased after the government acquired oil rents. More recent works explain business alliances with the government through the competition for resources between the capitalist class and the population at large. This article argues that the merchants’ political position vis-à-vis the ruling powers has not been consistent and has shifted between ‘voice’ and ‘loyalty’. To explain the choice of political action by the Kuwaiti business community the article compares the merchants’ role in two major contentious events-the popular uprising of 2011 and the 1989 pro-democracy movement. Despite the similarities between them, in 1989 prominent business figures were in the vanguard of opposition, while after 2011 they chose to re-emerge as government allies. The comparison suggests that the shift from ‘voice’ to ‘loyalty’ can be explained by the changing political field. I contend that the rise of new social forces and new types of political opposition antagonized business and forced it to side with the government in order to pursue its vital rent-seeking interests.

"Men of Light Blood: Revolution Stories, Humor, and Masculine Capital in Egypt",2018,"This article explores how revolution stories become a claim to manhood in Egypt, which may be used as leverage when men struggle to live up to the ideal of male provider. The revolution is stylized in the stories that youth have about their participation in the 2011 Thawrat Shabaab (youth revolution). In analyzing the narration and performance of the revolution stories, Herzfeld’s concept of performative excellence becomes relevant. Based on fieldwork undertaken in Cairo, Egypt, in 2013, the author argues that revolution stories and being good at telling jokes impart masculine capital. Inspired by Inhorn’s call for ethnographies on Arab men, this article engages with how Egyptian manhood is produced in interaction with peer groups and underlines the importance of male friendship and humor. Focusing on men from the upper-middle class of Cairo highlights how deeply classed (male) gender is in contemporary Egypt.

The French foreign policy U-turn in the Arab Spring–the case of Tunisia,2018,"As for many, the Arab uprisings of 2010–11 came as a surprise for France. After initial inactivity, followed by last minute support of the Tunisian regime, President Sarkozy took a U-turn by spearheading the military intervention in Libya and both Sarkozy and his successor Hollande announced a re-launch in the Franco-Tunisian relations. Starting from the assumption that France’s drastic foreign policy changes cannot be sufficiently explained by presidential change, we draw upon social-constructivist discourse-bound identity theory and provide a model for discursive legitimations of foreign policy changes. When the “permissive consensus” between the three discursive formations of the French foreign policy identity breaks up, drastic foreign policy turns may occur. By analysing the French policy actions and rhetoric towards Tunisia between 2007 and 2015, we show, however, that the sudden change tends to be rather ephemeral and that French foreign policy seems to be gradually returning to its pre-revolution approach.

Opposition visions for preserving Syria’s ethnic-sectarian mosaic,2018,"The excessive violence that has spread across virtually all of Syria since the 2011 uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Asad has so far prevented a serious debate about feasible solutions. Together with internal power struggles and the intervention of external actors, ideational factors and identity construction are playing a key role in shaping the dynamics of the Syrian conflict. Fear of exclusion in a future order dominated by radical Islamist forces is keeping the minority groups and some secularists close to the regime. However, there are also grounds for cautious optimism: as this paper shows, most actors from the moderate opposition acknowledge the need to take the minorities’ fears seriously and to provide them with guarantees of participation in a future political order, while stopping short of the option of a power-sharing arrangement between community representatives.

Using Volunteered Geographic Information to measure name changes of artificial geographical features as a result of political changes: a Libya case study,2018,"Over the past few years, political systems have changed in several countries of the Middle East as a result of citizen revolutions on the ruling regimes. These geopolitical changes have had effects on the names of artificial geographical features, such as roads and schools. Many of the names, especially those that were associated with previous regimes, were changed to become associated with the revolutions, their dates, their leaders, or their martyrs. The recent change in the paradigm of Web use towards data sharing and crowd-sourcing in the Web 2.0 provides new opportunities to get insight into a local community’s perception of political events. Crowd-sourced spatial data, often referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), can be contributed and accessed through various websites and data repositories. These data can supplement traditional data sources, such as road maps hosted by governmental offices. Libya’s governmental maps of urban infrastructure are scarce and incomplete. This provides an incentive for citizens and grassroots groups to collect and generate spatial data on their own and to express changed realities of feature names by the means of crowd-sourced mapping. Using two districts in Libya this study evaluates for five Web 2.0 platforms (OpenStreetMap, Wikimapia, Google Map Maker, Panoramio, and Flickr) to which extent VGI reflects name changes of geographical features as a result of the revolution in 2011. Other data sources, such as school directories posted by teachers on Facebook, serve as additional information for feature name change detection. Results show that the extent to which VGI reflects name changes based on the 2011 revolution in Libya varies strongly between VGI data sources.

Labor migrants as political leverage: Migration interdependence and coercion in the Mediterranean,2018,"How do states attempt to use their position as destinations for labor migration to influence sending states, and under what conditions do they succeed? I argue that economically driven cross-border mobility generates reciprocal political economy effects on sending and host states. That is, it produces migration interdependence. Host states may leverage their position against a sending state by either deploying strategies of restriction-curbing remittances, strengthening immigration controls, or both- or displacement-forcefully expelling citizens of the sending state. These strategies' success depends on whether the sending state is vulnerable to the political economy costs incurred by host states' strategy, namely if it is unable to absorb them domestically and cannot procure the support of alternative host states. I also contend that displacement strategies involve higher costs than restriction efforts and are therefore more likely to succeed. I demonstrate my claims through a least-likely, two-case study design of Libyan and Jordanian coercive migration diplomacy against Egypt in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. I examine how two weaker Arab states leveraged their position against Egypt, a stronger state but one vulnerable to migration interdependence, through the restriction and displacement of Egyptian migrants.

Who's There?

These studies are important but they overlook a significant individual-level dynamic that observers themselves care about: the effect that election observers have on local attitudes about elections. We argue that the activities of election observers can enhance elections' local credibility, but only when locals perceive observers as being both capable of detecting fraud and unbiased in that pursuit. Not all observer groups are seen as equally capable and unbiased. Evidence from a large-scale, nationally representative experiment in Tunisia supports the argument. A key finding is that observers from the Arab League - an organization criticized internationally for low-quality election observation - enhanced credibility the most because they were perceived locally as both relatively capable and unbiased.

At the Intersection of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Movements: The Case of Egypt and the Arab Spring,2018,"With a history of civic associations turned political, and an ongoing sociopolitical transformation in Egypt, social entrepreneurship (SE) has proliferated as an alternative to traditional forms of civic engagement such as charities on one hand and open activism on the other.

When Islamists lose: The politicization of Tunisia’s Ennahda Movement,2018,"This article is a case study of how Tunisia’s Islamist party, the Ennahda Movement, responded to new political opportunities that opened up after the 2011 Arab uprisings. It argues that Ennahda chose to make a hard-to-reverse commitment to politicization in the pursuit of electoral legitimacy, as protection from repression, and for fear of marginalization. The article demonstrates how the context of a democratic transition exposed internal debates within the movement over ideology, strategy, and organizational structure, ultimately dislocating the relationship between political ambitions and the religious social movement.

What they really want is a caliphate! british salafi reactions to the Arab spring,2018,"This contribution discusses the lack of references to the success of Salafi parties in the Middle East after the Arab Spring, in Egypt especially, by groups who self-identify as Salafi outside the Middle East. In their interpretation of the uprisings known as the Arab Spring, British Salafis have emphasised that Arab Muslim populations in the Middle East want an Islamic Caliphate despite cries for liberal rights and democracy. The aim of this contribution is to provide a theoretical frame for analysing a type of European Salafism on the rise preoccupied with establishing “Sharia Zones” and controlling fellow Muslims’ observance of Islamic principles in British cities but with little interest in political developments in Muslim majority countries. Rather than working for political influence, the British so-called Salafis in alMuhajiroun are preoccupied with defining a place of their own in their European context. Thus, the argument is that in order to understand current Salafi-inspired movements in the Middle East and Europe, it is necessary to analyse practice, rhetorical expressions and political context rather than how various groups self-identify.

Violence against women: the stark reality behind Morocco’s human rights progress,2018,"While the dominant narrative suggests that Morocco is a champion of stability and moderation in the ‘Arab world,’ this article challenges that discourse and argues that the state’s hagiographic narrative on women’s rights and gender equality is problematic. This article also draws attention to the discontinuity between the legal focus on violence against women (VAW) by women’s rights groups on one hand and the views and needs of non-elite Moroccan women on the other. This focus on reforms in the legal space has, concomitantly, left the existing power structures, which lay at the heart of inequality in Morocco, unchallenged. By illustrating these two arguments, the article also highlights a mutually fashioning, albeit asymmetrical, relationship between the government and women’s rights groups, which perpetuates inadequacies in both of their approaches.

From ‘Polytheists’ to ‘Partners in the Nation’: Islamist Attitudes Towards Coptic Egyptians in Post-revolutionary Egypt (2011–2013),2018,"In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, Islamist and Salafi organizations, some of them with a violent past, emerged as political actors and displayed a consistent effort to appear as serious and inclusive political contenders. This article studies the attitudes of actors such as the Salafi Nur Party and al-Gamāʿa al-Islāmiyya towards Coptic Egyptians in the post-revolutionary phase (2011–2013). It offers a perspective on how these actors navigated between the new political realities and their ideological positions. It argues that Islamist perceptions of the Copts have changed in response to the actions of the latter and that this is pivotal for understanding political attitudes, which seemed at times both moderate and dogmatic, volatile and contradictory. I therefore aim to go beyond the idea of ‘the Copts’ as a silent and homogenous minority and instead integrate the new form of Coptic activism which became visible and vocal after 2011. This approach helps towards a better understanding of how ‘the Copts’ appeared simultaneously in Salafi political discourses as useful political tools, infidels, enemies and equal citizens.

The intra-GCC crises: Mapping GCC fragmentation after 2011,2018,"If shared security perceptions were the foundation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), 2011 might be analysed as the watershed year in which the GCC began to fragment from within. Both the 2014 and 2017 intra-GCC crises were manifestations of conflicting security perceptions, formed across the GCC countries in and since 2011. Through an in-depth analysis of the events and of the subsequent reaction of the GCC governments in terms of discourse and foreign policy, we distinguish three different categories of conceptualization. First, the governments of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates perceived domestic protests as an 'intermestic' threat-triggered by the intersection of the international and domestic levels. Second, the leaders of Oman and Kuwait conceptualized protests in their countries as manageable domestic insecurity, rather than as fully-fledged externally orchestrated events-arguably because they did not perceive a direct danger to their stability and legitimacy. Finally, it can be argued that the government of Qatar did not see any real danger in the protests but instead viewed them as an opportunity to expand Doha's regional influence, arguably at Riyadh's expense. Unpacking the fundamental factors shaping such perceptions is the key to finding the appropriate framework for analysing GCC security in the future.

"How violence happens (or Not): Situational conditions of violence and nonviolence in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Syria",2018,"Objective: Recent studies show that violence is difficult to accomplish and only occurs under particular situational circumstances- but does this also apply to protests in authoritarian regimes? This article investigates the microdynamics of violence during the antiregime protests in Tunisia, Syria, and Bahrain. Method: The argument is based on visual data analysis of video footage of violent and nonviolent interactions from the uprisings in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Syria, as well as human rights reports, interviews with participants of demonstrations, and observation of a demonstration. Results: The article shows how violence by the state and protesters occurred when the perpetrator attacked from afar/above, from behind, at night, or from a vehicle, or attacked the outnumbered. In a few situations, violence was avoided when protesters confronted the security forces face to face. Conclusions: The article supports Randall Collins's argument (2008) that situational conditions allowing the perpetrator to overcome barriers of tension and fear are necessary for violence to occur, even in authoritarian regimes. However, situational dynamics can explain how but not why violence occurs, and Collins's guidelines for activists of how to avoid police violence are no panacea in authoritarian regimes.

One of the most significant results of this field research, directed by Professor Maria Teresa Grassi and Dr. Waleed Al-As’Ad, has been the discovery of a vast (probably private) Roman building containing a large peristyle and a series of rooms (Fig. 1)2. In November 2010, the last month of excavation before the beginning of Arab uprisings in March 2011, some local workers found a terracotta token, one of the so-called “Palmyrene banquet tesserae”.

EU support of polyarchy?

It indicates that the EU did not induce reluctant elites to reform or split, did not empower social movements and civil society, and only moderately contributed to the rise of favourable modernization socio-economic conditions in the country. At the same time, certain mediating factors, such as the monarchical, Islamic and hybrid nature of the Moroccan regime, the weaknesses of the 20 February Movement and civil society, unfavourable domestic revolutionary conditions and a diminished EU leverage over Moroccan elites, further undermined the EU's ability to support democracy. Thus, the article argues that the EU's contributions in Morocco during this period do not amount to the support of deep democracy but that of polyarchy. This has broader implications as to how we understand the EU as an external democracy supporter, external democracy support, and how democracy comes about in un-democratic societies.

More specifically, there is a clear lack of understanding of checks-and-balances in theory and practice of judicial independence. In this regard, the question of separation of powers and between the judiciary, the legislative and the executive imposes a call for reform for the role of the Minister of Justice, the Judicial Inspection Department, and the president of the primary court over judges.

In response, the paper presents the concept of judicial independence in Egypt, which reflects an understanding of autonomy rather than independence. More specifically, there is a clear lack of understanding of checks-and-balances in theory and practice of judicial independence. In this regard, the question of separation of powers and between the judiciary, the legislative and the executive imposes a call for reform for the role of the Minister of Justice, the Judicial Inspection Department, and the president of the primary court over judges. For that matter, this paper answers several questions regarding the formulation, organization, and separation of power in the Egyptian judiciary. ",['egy'],GO,True,False,False,1
"“Now drugs in Libya are much cheaper than food”: A qualitative study on substance use among young Libyans in post-revolution Tripoli, Libya",2018,"Background Libya is facing a rapidly growing epidemic of illicit drug use and HIV. This situation is fueled by a complex array of factors, mainly the consequences of the political and military turmoil of the Arab Spring. Although it is extensively documented in other settings that young people are one of the most vulnerable groups to both HIV and illicit drug use, no study has explored this issue among young people in Libya. The current study addresses this research gap. Methods This study is a qualitative study using in-depth interviews guided by a semi-structured questionnaire. We used a maximum variation, purposive sampling strategy to recruit male and female participants, aged 14–18 years, from schools, prisons, and community-based informal re-education and rehabilitation centers in Tripoli, Libya. Results In total, 31 participants were recruited: 6 females and 25 males. Sixteen participants were prisoners and residents of community-based informal re-education and rehabilitation centers, and 15 were recruited in schools. Risk factors for drug use included peer influence, the increased availability and affordability of drugs, disruption of social life and healthy recreational activities, and the distress and casualties of the war. Protective factors were religious beliefs and practices, good parent-child connectedness, and high self-esteem and future aspiration. Risk factors for HIV were insufficient knowledge related to HIV transmission and unsafe injection practices, such as sharing needles and syringes. Conclusion We found individual, interpersonal, family, and structural-level factors that interplayed to shape the vulnerability of young people to drug use and HIV infection in Tripoli, Libya. Structural factors, including the increased availability and affordability of drugs, provided the frame within which other factors, such as peer influence, insufficient knowledge of substance use, and HIV, operated to increase the vulnerability of young people to drugs and HIV, while religious beliefs and parent-child connectedness acted as protective factors. Multisectoral efforts and studies to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude and distribution of these problems are urgently needed.

"The crisis on the border of turkey: An analysis of syrian refugees’ education, shelter and healthcare",2018,"The year 2011 witnessed a series of social movements against ingrained authoritarian regimes in the Arab world, starting in Tunisia. At least 500,000 people, lost their lives in the internal turmoil that started in Syria on 15 March 2011, when the belated local version of the ‘Arab Spring’ escalated into a violent civil war. In this period, 13.5 million people became in need of dire help in Syria, which has a net population of 20 million. Of 6.3 million people who were displaced, 4.9 million sought refuge in neighboring countries. The first known group to escape Turkey was identified on 29th April 2011, when a group of 250 people crossed the border to seek refuge in the Yayladağı district of Hatay. The Turkish Government described passing people as “guests” in the statement made on the same day and announced that the borders would continue open for these “guests” fleeing persecution and war, vouchsafing that their basic needs would be met in Turkey and that no one would be forcefully sent back. As the number of refugees from Syria increased, camps started to open in different districts of Hatay and then in other provinces along the long Syrian border. Food, healthcare, security, social activities, education, religious activities, and other services are provided by the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), public institutions and organizations and the Turkish Red Crescent in these camps.

"Between Scylla and Charybdis: religion, the military and support for democracy among Egyptians, 2011–2014",2018,"Democracy as a form of civilian rule must navigate a path between clerical and military powers, both of which are highly engaged in the politics of post-Mubarak Egypt. The authors ask in this article how mass support for democracy changed in Egypt between 2011 and 2014, and how this support is connected with views on religion and the role of the military. This question is important for understanding the prospects for democracy in a major state in the Arab world. It is also of comparative interest because of what change in the social and ideological drivers of mass attitudes may tell us about the nature of democratic support more generally. The authors’ analysis is based on nationally representative surveys of Egyptians in 2011 after the country’s first post-Mubarak parliamentary elections and in 2014 after the removal of the Islamist President Morsi. The findings indicate that Egyptians in large numbers favour both democracy and unfettered military intervention in politics. The authors also observe important shifts in the social bases of support for democracy away from religion but also from economic aspiration. Negative political experience with democratic procedures in 2011–2013 seems to be the strongest factor behind the observed decrease in democratic support.

Changing pattern and etiology of maxillofacial fractures during the civil uprising in Western Libya,2018,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changing pattern in characteristics of maxillofacial fractures and concomitant injuries in Western Libya During revolution and to assess the association between mechanism of injury and fracture patterns. Material and Methods: A retrospective review of medical records and radiographs of 187 patients treated for maxillofacial fractures from January 2010 to December 2012 was performed, there were 326 fractures in 187 patients. Results: The male: female ratio was 6:1. Most fractures occurred in patients aged 11 to 40 years, and few injuries occurred in patients aged > 50 years. Most fractures occurred from motor vehicle accidents, and other most frequent causes included assault, gunshot, and fall injuries. Most maxillofacial fractures involved the mandible, zygomatic complex, or maxilla. Most mandibular fractures occurred at the parasymphysis, angle, or condyle. Associated injuries most frequently involved the head, chest, and extremities. Most patients were treated with open reduction (132 patients [71%]), and 26 patients (14%) were treated nonoperatively. There were 21 complications (11%). Conclusions: In summary, motor vehicle accidents were the most frequent cause of maxillofacial fracture in western Libya, possibly because of the lack of seat belt legislation. Interpersonal violence was a less frequent cause of maxillofacial fracture, possibly because of the religious restriction on alcohol consumption.

The use of political motherhood in Egypt’s Arab Spring uprising and aftermath,2018,"Political motherhood, which uses traditional motherhood to mobilize and sustain women’s political participation, is understudied in political science. Women played a significant role in Egypt’s Arab Spring and its aftermath by “bargaining with patriarchy” and strategically using traditional motherhood to access the political sphere.

We illustrate it with examples drawn from news articles on women’s political activism and social media posts by Egyptian activists. Our argument explores how women’s agency and the larger political context in which women operate reveals how political motherhood takes the particular shape that it does. In the context of Egypt, we examine how the state’s choice to highlight women as “hypervisible” citizens, worthy of protection, backfired. Through a bottom-up political motherhood, women used their respectability as mothers in need of state protection against the state, thereby legitimizing anti-Mubarak and anti-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrations and challenging these governments.

"The ties that bind: Internet communication technologies, networked authoritarianism, and ‘voice’ in the Syrian diaspora",2018,"Internet communication technologies (ICTs) enable diasporas to act transnationally by facilitating ties to their places of origin and providing low-cost ways to mobilize against home-country regimes.

In order to investigate the operation and effects of what I call digitally-enabled transnational repression, this study analyzes data that include original interviews with pro-revolution Syrian activists based in the US and Britain. The findings demonstrate that the presence and tactics of pro-regime agents online during the onset of Syria’s 2011 uprising (i) eroded respondents’ transnational ties and (ii) deterred many from using ICTs to contest the Assad regime.

In the Service of Democratic Governance: The African Union Normative Framework on Unconstitutional Change of Government and ECOWAS Protocol on Good Governance and Democracy in the Post-Arab Spring,2018,"For the crafters and drafters of the African Union’s (AU) Constitutive Acts particularly the Addis Ababa Charter and the Lomé Declaration of July 2000 and the Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) Protocol on Good Governance and Democracy, the novel idea was to provide a regional, sub-regional, platform of support to democratic governments and also deter any forms of unconstitutionalism. However, recent events have put to the test the political capacity of these organisations to uphold the sanctity of the normative framework and the protocol supportive of democratic processes. In the case of the AU, the outburst of revolutionary movements in the north African region provided a platform for a thorough assessment of the AU’s Normative Frameworks related to constitutionalism and democracy. While it was accepted that the case of Tunisia followed the democratic process, the Egyptian and Libyan cases were seen as a negation of the principles of the framework.Likewise,in the case of the ECOWAS, there were myriads of problems that tested the organisation’s democratic credentials. For instance, Guinea Bissau experienced two coup d’états in two years (2009 and 2012), Guinea in December 2008; Niger in March 2010; and Burkina Faso in 2015. The AU and ECOWAS have been challenged and pulled along by two parallel but not equal forces: the need to ensure respect for the principle of total rejection of unconstitutional changes of government, and the necessity to recognise the reality on the ground. This study therefore employs both historical and comparative methodologies to assess the roles of these organisations in being true to the values of democracy as contained in their normative framework and the protocol, as well asalso examines the challenges faced in the context of the situations in Libya, Mali and Guinea Bissau.

Creating and sustaining Islamic financial centers: Bahrain in the wake of financial and political crises,2018,"Although primarily concentrated in countries with Muslim majorities, Islamic finance has become a global industry representing both a decentering of the global financial architecture and the emergence of an urban network that resides beyond the confines of traditional world city literature. While geographers have identified the “Mecca’s” of the Islamic finance industry–one of which is Bahrain–there remains a need to identify the factors necessary to create and sustain centers of Islamic finance. This paper examines these factors through a firm-level survey of foreign and local Islamic financial institutions in Bahrain, in conjunction with key informant interviews with representatives of these firms. We find that while Bahrain’s entrenched institutional advantages have preserved its role as a center in the Islamic financial landscape, ongoing political instability and the increasing attractiveness of new and emerging centers are threatening this role. As the country navigates the current social and political unrest, questions are raised as to what it takes to be an Islamic financial center.

The initial euphoria emphasizing the liberating aspect of technology – whereby individuals were finally able to collectively mobilize against repressive rulers, while simultaneously documenting the atrocities committed by them – led many tech optimists to believe that it was only a matter of time until technology helped to overturn despotic governments all over the world. Fast forward to 2018, where the ongoing conflict in Syria, the global surveillance disclosures leaked by Edward Snowden, and rising right-wing populism in Europe and the US have significantly dampened the public’s enthusiasm over the role of digital technologies. Both the effusive optimism of the early days of the Arab Spring and today’s overly dramatic headlines claiming that the Internet is to blame for all recent political developments are likely wrong. They are wrong because they tend to overestimate the role and impact of digital technologies on societal developments. But more importantly, they fail to take a nuanced look at the complex ways in which digital technology is in fact amplifying and changing politics today. Amid these broader developments, the authors in this Special Issue bring together important reflections on the precarious relationship between digital technology, state repression and local resistance. The individual contributions span a number of important aspects pertaining to the ambiguity of digital technology, whereby precisely the characteristics that make it so useful for mobilization, selfempowerment and resistance allow it to be controlled and abused by repressive authorities.

It concludes with a comparative analysis of the different export options for the evacuation of East Med Gas to the EU. ","['isr', 'rus', 'egy', 'cyp']",GO,True,False,False,4
Citizens of the margin: citizenship and youth participation on the Moroccan social web,2018,"This paper examines how marginalized youth in Morocco use YouTube to contest hegemonic discourses of state power and institutional practices of social exclusion. The paper analyses a user-generated, YouTube web-series, Tales of Bouzebal, as a performance of marginality and a social critique of state bureaucracies and institutions in the context of post-Arab Spring Morocco. Using a combined method of textual and discourse analyses, the paper argues that the new media practices of producing and consuming user-generated video are best understood as practices of cultural citizenship that contribute to social change through the production of counter-discursive political subjectivities among youth in MENA. The paper posits that the concept of citizenship needs to be expanded to account for citizen participatory media practices that contest the conditions of marginality and inequality sustained by normative definitions of citizenship.

Arab spring: Review of factors for people's uprising in Tunisia,2018,"Some years ago, the world was taken aback by the people's uprising or better known as 'Arab Spring'. This historical event began in Tunisia and spread to a few other countries which were forced to deal with the people's demonstrations. The Tunisian Revolution or Jasmine Revolution witnessed the fall of President Zine El Abidin Ben Ali's regime. After 23 years under his rule, the society began to feel disgusted and united in an uprising against the regime. Thus, the purpose of this working paper is to identify the factors which led to the people's uprising in Tunisia in social, economic and political aspects. This research is a qualitative study with a document analysis approach to verify whether information is obtained from authoritative sources. Research results find that there were some factors in social, economic and political aspects which were the prime causes leading to the people's uprising.

Import vulnerability in the Middle East: effects of the Arab spring on Egyptian wheat trade,2018,"The ‘Arab Spring’ spilled over to Egypt from neighbouring Arab countries in the first half of 2011. General chaos during the political instabilities suddenly caused high uncertainty for consumers and traders, and temporarily rendered institutions dysfunctional. This eventually might have led to a negative market shock, impeding economic activity in general and, in particular, trade. Wheat is the main ingredient in the Egyptian diet and is heavily subsidised in the country. The general availability of cheap wheat flour creates a very high domestic demand for wheat. Therefore, Egypt is highly dependent on wheat imports from other countries for ensuring food security. This dependency makes the country vulnerable to increasing food prices and other shocks to the world market which might challenge flows of imports. This paper investigates the effects of domestic political instability on the wheat trade in Egypt. We analysed monthly trade data for wheat from the Comtrade Database of the United Nations, particularly imports and exports of wheat and wheat flour in Egypt from 2010 to 2014. The analysis showed pronounced and stable seasonal patterns whereby the pattern of 2011, the year of most intensive political turmoil in Egypt, was found to differ significantly from other years. We found robust evidence for a strong, negative demand shock in the second half of 2011 caused by the substantial and enduring political instabilities in the country which resulted from the Arab Spring.

Legitimacy and protest under authoritarianism: explaining student mobilization in Egypt and Morocco during the Arab uprisings,2018,"Political protests constitute a major concern to authoritarian regimes. Existing research has argued that they indicate a lack of regime legitimacy. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between legitimacy and protest participation remains rare. Based on new survey data from Morocco and Egypt, this study investigates whether legitimacy played a significant role in student mobilization during the 2011 uprisings. In doing so, we first develop a context-sensitive concept of legitimacy. This allows us to differentiate the ruler’s legitimacy claims and the citizens’ legitimacy beliefs. Furthermore, we distinguish between two different objects of legitimacy: the broader political community and specific regime institutions. Our empirical analysis suggests that legitimacy had an independent and significant impact on students’ protest participation, yet in more nuanced ways than generally assumed. While protest participation was driven by nationalist sentiments in Egypt, it was motivated by dissatisfaction with the political performance of specific regime institutions in Morocco.

Democratic transitions in the levant: Prospects for restoring a regional order; [Levant’da demokratik değişim: Bölgesel bir düzenin onarılmasına yönelik beklentiler],2018,"The 2011 Arab uprisings exacerbated conflict and turmoil in the Levant, with the civil war in Syria constituting the dominant event in the region since that point in time and drawing the surrounding countries into its destructive vortex. The changes wrought by the uprisings have intermingled with the pre-existing conflicts in the Levant and with new local and pan-Middle Eastern confrontations in pernicious ways. Among the outcomes of this crisis are that Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine —whose current political situations will be addressed in this paper— are experiencing a rise in authoritarianism. However, this paper argues that the Levant will not overcome its current disorder and regain a degree of order —in the sense either of stability or of recognized rules governing relations between regional actors— unless Levantine states undergo a degree of democratization, meaning they adopt some degree of accountability, pluralism and respect for basic freedoms and good governance. Democracy is closely linked to the emergence of peace and security but is also a condition for them to endure.

Understanding New Middle Eastern Leadership: An Operational Code Approach,2018,"Political Islam and Islamist organizations have broadly gained strength across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in the post-Cold War era. Following the Arab uprisings, the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), generally viewed as the world’s largest and most influential Islamist organization, has shaped the wider landscape of MENA politics. This study examines MB leadership by comparing M. Morsi of Egypt, R. Ghannouchi of Tunisia, and K. Meshaal of Gaza as examples of Islamist leaders to explain their political belief systems and predict their foreign-policy behavior. We use the operational code approach, a content-analysis software and statistical tests to conduct the study. Results show that the three leaders’ foreign policy beliefs are analogous to the averages of world leaders. Results also partially support the hypothesis that their foreign-policy propensities are similar to each other. We conclude that despite the conventional portrayal of MB leadership, these leaders use negotiation and cooperation to settle their differences in foreign affairs, and the best way to approach them is to engage in a Rousseauvian assurance game that emphasizes international social cooperation. Results also suggest important implications in terms of mainstream international relations theories.

What Makes Muslim Women Entrepreneurs Successful? A Field Study Examining Religiosity and Social Capital in Tunisia,2018,"The present study sheds light upon critical factors that help explain the entrepreneurial success among Muslim women living in a democratic Tunisia, a Muslim-majority country considered by many to be the lone Arab Spring success story. We hypothesized that successful entrepreneurs need social capital, including the capital that comes from marriage and high levels of wasta (the Arabic concept of having personal connections with influential others). Moreover, given the lack of empirical attention paid to the role of the culture, language, and customs associated with Islam on women’s empowerment, we examine whether religiosity is related to entrepreneurial performance among Tunisian women. Data collected with 84 female entrepreneurs participating in entrepreneurship training programs across Tunisia reveal that two forms of social capital, marital status and wasta, are related to training center directors’ ratings of women entrepreneurs’ performance, suggesting that social capital is a critical asset for Muslim women entrepreneurs. Religiosity, on the other hand, had no statistically significant relationship with entrepreneurial performance. Our study contributes to research on entrepreneurship by identifying wasta as a form of social capital that may be necessary for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the Middle East and North Africa and by taking an initial step towards better understanding the empirical (and controversial) relationship between religiosity and career success among Muslim women. We recommend that training organizations supporting entrepreneurs directly assist women in the development of social capital and acknowledge, rather than ignore, that nepotism and wasta are linked to entrepreneurial success in some cultures.

Groundwater balance politics: Aquifer overexploitation in the Orontes River Basin,2018,"Aquifer overexploitation is widely used to describe negative effects on groundwater resources but has no agreed scientific definition. Usually viewed as a situation where average aquifer abstraction exceeds average recharge, a diagnosis of groundwater overdraft calls upon specific hydrogeological instruments, based on the groundwater balance approach.

We propose to discuss the politics of groundwater overexploitation diagnoses in Syria and more specifically the Orontes River Basin prior to the 2011 uprising and subsequent conflict. Groundwater overdraft at the national level became a matter of concern in official discourse in the late 1990s as diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation became commonplace in international reports. The steady increase in groundwater abstraction in relation to Syria's centralised agricultural planning from the 1960s onward had undeniable consequences on the hydro-social system. However, the way diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation - in particular groundwater balances - were constructed and used to support water policies implemented from the mid-1990s onwards question the rationalities and interests lying behind technical arguments and actions.

The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Arab adolescents: Findings from Jordan,2018,"Background: The lack of research regarding the current profile of adolescent depression in the Arab countries in general, and Jordan in particular, makes it difficult to design, implement, and disseminate effective interventions to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescent depression in the region. The purpose of this study was to estimate a national prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents in Jordan, and to identify characteristics associated with severity of depression. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, nationally representative school survey was utilized. A total of 2,349 Jordanian adolescents aged 12–17 completed and returned the survey packets, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II and measures of sociodemographics and health history. Participants represented all three regions in the country, with 34% from the northern (suburban) region, 43% from the central (urban) region, and 23% from the southern (rural) region. Results: The majority of the adolescents were females (59%) and 15–17 years old (67%). Almost 14% reported having at least one chronic health problem, 15% reported having a mental health problem, 25% reported having academic difficulties, 8% reported that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, and 22% reported that they had sought psychological help at some point in the past. The mean total depression score was 16.3 (SD = 11.2, 95% CI = 15.8–16.7), with 34% of the sample reporting moderate to severe depression. Depression was significantly higher among respondents who were female, ages 14–15 years, and living in families with low monthly incomes; and who reported having a chronic health problem, mental health problem, learning difficulty, a psychiatric diagnosis and/or seeking previous psychological help. Conclusions: Our findings should serve as an alarm, particularly given that rates of depression in the Arab countries are expected to increase rapidly in the context of the Arab Spring. Healthcare providers, researchers, and educators should focus attention on developing effective and culturally appropriate screening, prevention, and intervention approaches using evidence-based guidelines to promote Jordanian adolescent mental health, particularly for depression. ","The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Arab adolescents: Findings from Jordan Background: The lack of research regarding the current profile of adolescent depression in the Arab countries in general, and Jordan in particular, makes it difficult to design, implement, and disseminate effective interventions to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescent depression in the region. The purpose of this study was to estimate a national prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents in Jordan, and to identify characteristics associated with severity of depression. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, nationally representative school survey was utilized. A total of 2,349 Jordanian adolescents aged 12–17 completed and returned the survey packets, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II and measures of sociodemographics and health history. Participants represented all three regions in the country, with 34% from the northern (suburban) region, 43% from the central (urban) region, and 23% from the southern (rural) region. Results: The majority of the adolescents were females (59%) and 15–17 years old (67%). Almost 14% reported having at least one chronic health problem, 15% reported having a mental health problem, 25% reported having academic difficulties, 8% reported that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, and 22% reported that they had sought psychological help at some point in the past.

When the Present Sends Back to the Past: Reading the Kurdish Issue in the 2010s,2018,"Since 2011, the emergence of the Islamic State (IS) and its anti-Kurdish violence, the new cold war of Iran and Russia versus Turkey, and the Tayyip Erdogan regime’s coercive policies against the Kurds both in Turkey and Syria, entirely have redefined the century-long Kurdish issue in the Middle East. It also has affected deeply the Kurdish political elite and constrained it to remilitarize the Kurdish conflict and society. How does this elite define the Kurdish issue after years of stasis in Iraq and in Syria? Which senses does it give to the crisis of the previously strong Westphalian states in the region?

Prospects for economic integration in Levant; [Levant’ta ekonomik bütünleşme beklentileri],2018,"For many decades domestic political instability, anti-globalization economic ideologies and geopolitical turmoil prevented the Levant countries from developing closer economic relations. In an unexpected turn of events the AKP government in Turkey initiated proactive diplomacy aimed at the promotion of closer economic ties with Levant countries and these efforts led to a significant increase in trade and investment between the Levant countries between 2002-2010. This progress came to an end with the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. These uprisings evolved into a violent sectarian war in Syria and caused considerable damage to Turkey’s economic and diplomatic relations with Syria and Egypt. The level of sectarian violence has declined significantly in Syria and there is some potential that a political solution can be implemented. This outcome will have a positive effect on the region’s prospects for restarting the economic cooperation that was suspended in 2011. The short-term prospects for a multi-lateral economic agreement are not high but an expansion of bilateral economic relations is more likely among the countries that enjoy more political and economic stability.

Levantine challenges on Turkish foreign policy; [Türk Dış Politikası’nda Levant],2018,"Turkey’s perception of the Levant has been hazy in modern times and the country has not constructed a holistic approach towards the region until recently, despite the fact that Turkey has sought closer cooperation with the Levantine countries since the late 1990s.

Capturing the flag: The struggle for national identity in nonviolent revolutions,2018,"One goal of nonviolent resistance movements is to legitimize themselves in opposition to governments by undermining the latter's leadership. We argue nonviolent groups that can 'own' the national identity are more likely to succeed, as they can assert the legitimacy of their vision for the state, and persuade other sectors of society to support their cause. Our argument is supported by the Arab Spring uprisings, where those resistance movements that were able to identify and claim ownership over a homogeneous national identity were more successful in pressing their claims. We view national identity as a component of symbolic power in both successful and unsuccessful nonviolent revolutions. We supplement our argument via a comparison of the Arab Spring uprisings featuring Egypt, Bahrain, and Libya, with nonviolent movements of the past: The 'early' cases (Northern Ireland, Iran, and the Philippines) and the color revolutions (Serbia, Georgia, and the Ukraine). We posit that the role of national identity, while not a determinant of success, can play an important role in the struggle for legitimacy, which may help determine the prospects of success for these movements.

EU religious engagement in the Southern Mediterranean: Much ado about nothing?,2018,"Since the Arab uprisings, religious engagement is central to EU relations with the Southern Mediterranean. Given that the EU is a liberal-secular power, this article investigates why and how the EU is practising religious engagement and whether it is a rupture with past EU modalities of engagement in the region. The main finding is that EU religious engagement constitutes both a physical and ontological security-seeking practice. This is illustrated in three steps. First, EU’s physical security is ensured by the promotion of state-sponsored forms of religion in Morocco and Jordan that aim at moderating Islam. Second, the framing of religion as an expertise issue in the EEAS and European diplomacies reinforces EU’s self-identity narrative as a secular power. This self-identity is, however, subject to politicization and framing contestation through the case of Freedom of Religion or Belief and the protection of Christian minorities in the Arab world. Overall, this article finds that EU religious engagement is conducive to selective engagement with some religious actors, which could potentially lead to more insecurities and polarization in the region.

Experimenting with alternative futures in Cairo: young Muslim volunteers between god and the nation,2018,"This article investigates young middle-class Egyptians’ engagement with the religious and national visions of Resala, Egypt’s largest Muslim youth NGO, and how they come to rethink themselves existentially and politically through this commitment, in the context of the 2011 uprising and its aftermath. I show how their volunteering through Resala, shaped by specific sociopolitical circumstances, paved the way for personal hopes to develop into utopian aspirations. Demonstrating the dynamic relationship between the formation of political subjectivities and how utopias emerge, develop and are sometimes shattered, I argue that while utopic aspirations continue to characterise parts of Egypt’s 2011 youth generation, for others, such aspirations have to give way for other more personal concerns to establish a secure adult life. Therefore, activism and experiments with societal alternatives in contexts like the Egyptian continue to depend on inclusive and less risky spaces for civic engagement outside formal politics and institutions.

The stellar economic performance of the Turkish national economy transformed Turkey’s position on the world stage, politically as well as economically, boosting the country’s image in the world. Since the beginning of civil war in Syria following the ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings from 2011 onwards, the number of refugees in Turkey reached over 4 million as estimated by the UN in mid-August 2017, making Turkey the host country with the largest net refugee population in the world, to say nothing of the vast population of unregistered refugees. The Turkish receptive policies from the outset were predicated on the assumption that the conflict would come to a swift conclusion, allowing the Syrian “guests” (a word chosen in national political discourse rather than “refugees”) to return home, precluding the need to plan for their long-term or permanent stay in Turkey. Unstable political conditions in the region and Turkey’s generous open-door policy have made it a symbol of Islamic brotherhood and humanitarianism and it is the main hope of displaced Syrians and the region in general to ameliorate the humanitarian catastrophe and seek to end the conflict.

Between reform and islam: The Arab spring in Jordan 2011–2014,2018,"This article discusses the Arab Spring in Jordan and the reasons the Hashemite regime was able to survive it. Liberals, retired military officers, young people, members of tribes, and members of the Muslim Brotherhood all participated in the demonstrations against the regime, which began in January 2011. In the beginning, it seemed that diversified demonstrations would bring about the regime’s collapse, as happened in other Arab countries. But in the end, it turned out that each group acted in its own interests. Tribal leaders worried about economic concerns, liberals sought to promote political reform, and the Muslim Brotherhood demanded the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. The lack of a common goal combined with Jordan’s policy of allowing demonstrations free from the fear of violent repression, sapped protesters’ motivation and minimized the number of participants. The fear of the type of anarchy and terror seen in Syria and Egypt also frightened the protesters and led them to the conclusion that it is better to live in an undemocratic but stable regime than pursue a fight for democracy that might end badly. Ultimately, it was King Abdullah’s astute political strategy in combination with international contingencies that enabled Jordan’s Hashemite regime to survive the Arab Spring.

Syria’s anti-imperialist mask: unveiling contradictions of the left through anti-capitalist thought,2018,"This article, written in 2016, aims to historically situate the neoliberalization of Syria and global and regional relations of power in relation to debates on the current Syrian uprising. It aims to highlight and challenge leftist debates and positions on the Syrian regime and revolution by using leftist analytics to debunk political positions. This is done by drawing upon the thought of Syrian leftists who are active agents of the revolution and juxtaposing them against the thought of a strong leftist current that shows a spectrum of support for the Syrian regime. The current situation in Syria serves as an example of shifts in leftist thought. This article argues that the predominant left position that is rooted in struggles of the 1960s and 1970s has shifted to analyses based solely on political position as opposed to being situated within economic analyses. As such, this article argues that the left is void of Marxist analysis. In addition, by engaging in questions of (anti-)imperialism, this text argues that in the postsocialist temporality, the struggle of imperialism, and specifically US vs. Russian power struggle, is no longer organized around competing global ideologies, but is rather organized around power within the capitalist system. In this regard, you can see Russia as not offering an alternative as the Soviet Union once was, but is rather engulfed in the system of global capitalism. Finally, this article seeks to highlight alternative articulations of leftist and left-leaning grassroots intellectuals and young people in regard to the Syrian uprising.

It aims to highlight and challenge leftist debates and positions on the Syrian regime and revolution by using leftist analytics to debunk political positions. This is done by drawing upon the thought of Syrian leftists who are active agents of the revolution and juxtaposing them against the thought of a strong leftist current that shows a spectrum of support for the Syrian regime. The current situation in Syria serves as an example of shifts in leftist thought. This article argues that the predominant left position that is rooted in struggles of the 1960s and 1970s has shifted to analyses based solely on political position as opposed to being situated within economic analyses. As such, this article argues that the left is void of Marxist analysis. In addition, by engaging in questions of (anti-)imperialism, this text argues that in the postsocialist temporality, the struggle of imperialism, and specifically US vs. Russian power struggle, is no longer organized around competing global ideologies, but is rather organized around power within the capitalist system. In this regard, you can see Russia as not offering an alternative as the Soviet Union once was, but is rather engulfed in the system of global capitalism.

The EU and Islamist parties in Tunisia and Egypt after the Arab uprisings: A story of selective engagement,2018,"This article argues that the new EU’s selective engagement with Islamist parties in its Southern neighbourhood following the Arab uprisings is the result of a partial shift in the EU’s frame used to understand political Islam, combined with a form of pragmatism that puts a premium on finding interlocutors in the region. Using the case studies of Tunisia and Egypt, it shows that the EU has replaced its previous monolithic conception of political Islam with an understanding that is more sensitive to differences among Islamists. This opens the door to some forms of engagement with those actors that renounce violence and demonstrate their commitment to work within the confines of democratic rules, while violent strands of political Islam and conservative groups remain at arm’s length.

Standing ‘bare hands’ against the Syrian regime: the turn to armed resistance and the question of civilian protection,2018,"Perhaps the most serious ethical challenge to pacifism is the argument for the necessity of military action to protect civilians from violence.  Whether articulated by IR scholars or armed rebels, such argumentation depends upon largely uninvestigated notions about the efficacy of violence as a tool for protection.  This paper takes on this presumed link between violence and protection by examining the case of Syria, where this argument has had particular salience, and whether the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in 2011, a few months into the violent repression of anti-government protests, did in fact serve to protect civilians as intended.  This case points to an often overlooked distinction between the refusal of soldiers to fire on unarmed activists and the subsequent decision of these soldiers to turn their arms back on the regime to ‘protect’ unarmed activists—two courses of action that can have radically different effects on conflict dynamics involving a nonviolent movement.  Through analysis of casualty figures, military/security force behaviour, and regime discourse, the article finds, counter-intuitively, that the arming of the opposition did not ultimately protect civilians and may have actually made them more vulnerable than they were when the protest movement remained primary nonviolent.

Reassessing the risk conditions for political instability in the light of the Arab Spring,2017,"In today’s globalized world, multinational firms contend with a diverse set of risk factors in their worldwide operations. The recent regime changes in northern African countries, also called the Arab Spring, have highlighted that political instability is one of these factors. As researchers and existing indices of political instability largely failed to predict those developments, firms had not incorporated them into their risk calculations and hence incurred losses while having to adapt their operations. This paper examines the conditions that contributed to the recent instability in North Africa using Tunisia and Egypt as case studies. It evaluates the extent to which existing measures of political instability incorporate those conditions. The analysis reveals that the main conditions contributing to the political turmoil can be seen in socio-economic factors, namely inequality, poverty, youth unemployment, a growing youth population, and especially in the case of Egypt an independent military. These findings reveal gaps in current measures of political instability, whose dominant focus is on factors describing violence and changes in the political system while neglecting the influence of a country’s socio-economic environment.

"Political Theology, Democracy, and the Exception in the Egyptian Revolution",2017,"As the sixth anniversary of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square passes, those uprisings and the events that followed continue pose important challenges not only for students of Middle Eastern and North African politics, but also for students of political theory and political theology. While scholars debate the extent to which the “Arab Spring” has amounted to a truly revolutionary turn of events, it is commonly accepted that the protests that swept the region were exceptional in their unanticipated and profound disruption of ordinary affairs. Under the influence of Carl Schmitt's theory of sovereignty, “the exception” has become a key figure in contemporary reflections on political theology, but attention to events in Egypt suggests that the familiar figure of the exception has not yet been mined for all of its implications for democratic practice. Slipping below grand articulations of the exception as a moment of sovereign decision, or as the suspension of the law, this essay turns its attention to the minor, everyday, background patterns of exceptionality that accompany the emergence of democratic practices outside the purview of the sovereign state. I argue that there is an intimate connection between the forms of exceptionality produced by longstanding practices of Egyptian secularism, the forms of exceptionality peculiar to the 2011 uprisings and their aftermath, and the forms of exceptionality that both make and unmake democratic practices. My argument has three parts: first Egyptian secularism is a process that manages and transforms authorized forms of Islamic practice, while at the same time producing exceptional formations, of which the Muslim Brotherhood is a key example; second that revolutionary politics can be understood as a matter of opening and sustaining the kind of exceptional circumstances that attended the 2011 uprisings, and that this can be usefully framed as an open-ended process of conversion; third that democratic practice requires courting both kinds of exception, despite their challenges, ambivalences, and potential dangers.

We shed light on Tunisia's democratic prospects by examining (1) the degree to which major terrorist attacks in 2015 influenced Tunisian public opinion on democracy and (2) the extent to which preference for a democratic system affected opinions on the prospects for democracy in Tunisia. We use data from three waves of a nationwide survey conducted just before and just after Tunisia's first major terrorist attack, and just after the country's second major terrorist attack. We demonstrate that after the attacks the Tunisian public became less favourable toward democracy and less optimistic that Tunisia would soon be ready for it. Such scepticism was widespread, affecting people who preferred democracy as much as those who did not. We conclude that the prospects for Tunisian democracy are more precarious than is sometimes assumed.

In particular, it argues that emigrants’ family members are more likely to vote for Salafi parties for several reasons, including the transfer of religious remittances by Egyptian emigrants to the Gulf and the influence of transnational Salafi networks. In order to test our argument, we conducted an original public opinion survey with around 1100 individuals between January 12, 2012 and January 25, 2012, just after the Egyptian parliamentary election. We find that individuals with family members who had emigrated to the Gulf voted heavily for Islamist parties, particularly the Freedom and Justice Party and the Nour Party. Further analysis shows that there is no statistical difference between individuals with and without emigrant family members in voting for the Muslim Brotherhood, while the Nour’s popularity among voters with emigrant family members is substantial and statistically significant. In particular, we find that the strongest support for the Nour came from individuals whose family members had immigrated to Saudi Arabia, whereas those whose family members had immigrated to other countries, including other Gulf countries, do not differ significantly from non-emigrant family members in their party preferences.

By exploring factors influencing legislators and their demand and need for legislative advocacy, this study sheds light on the inner works of policy makers and ways to influence them. This study finds that, contrary to the idea that governments in developing countries do not want civil society participation in politics, Tunisian legislators are open to and eager for legislative advocacy. Based on 40 survey conducted face to face with Tunisian legislators in the National Constituent Assembly, and archival analysis of the National Constituents Assembly sessions' minutes from 2011 until 2014, this study finds that Tunisian legislators have a high level of trust in CSOs, want their expertise, and are influenced by them when voting in parliament. These results have several potential impacts on understanding of the relationship between CSOs and government and more specifically legislature.

Perception of emotional climate in a revolution: Test of a multistage theory of revolution in the Tunisian context,2017,"Participation in social movements and collective action depends upon people's capacity to perceive their societal context. We examined this question in the context of Arab Spring revolutions. In a classic theory of revolution highlighting the role of collective emotions, Brinton (1938) claimed that revolutions, far from chaos, proceed in an orderly sequence involving four stages: euphoria, degradation, terror, and restoration. The emotional climate (EC) as perceived by ordinary Tunisian citizens (2,699 women and 3,816 men) was measured during the 4 years of the Tunisian revolution. A quadratic pattern of perceived EC measures over time provided strong support to Brinton's model. In addition, three different analyses suggested the presence of four distinct stages in the evolution of perceived EC. Third, the socio-political developments in Tunisia during the four stages proved entirely consistent with both Brinton's theoretical model and the perceived EC indicators. Finally, social identification proved closely related to the temporal evolution of positive EC scores. In sum, data from this study not only lend support to the views put forth in an heretofore untested classic theory of revolution but also demonstrate that psychosocial measurements can validly monitor a major process of socio-political transformation.

The rewards of failure: Persisting military rule in Egypt,2017,"The Egyptian military, having been bogged down for almost five years in a losing war in Yemen, had to deal with a crushing defeat in June 1967. Similar defeats elsewhere, such as in Argentina and Greece, have led to militaries being removed from power. In Egypt, however, Nasser salvaged his and the military’s rule by purging elements of the High Command, by repressing the nascent protest movement and by calling in the Soviets to rebuild and essentially command his armed forces. Half a century later, the military is even more firmly in control of Egypt. Having ridden out successive challenges to its authority, including Sadat’s attempted civilianization, the global Third Wave of democracy, Mubarak’s effort to establish a family dynasty, the uprising of 2011 and the Muslim Brothers’ one-year interregnum, the Egyptian military’s political persistence is virtually unmatched in the region or indeed, the world. After tracing the historical evolution of military rule from 1967, this article explores the structural bases for the persistence of its power before assessing the overwhelmingly negative consequences of this remarkably protracted military rule of what was once the leading Arab country.

The Fiscal Politics of Rebellious Grievance in the Arab World: Egypt and Jordan in Comparative Perspective,2017,"In the aftermath of the 2011 protests, narrow economic arguments for revolt have proliferated. This essay broadens the debate by arguing that states’ latent fiscal weakness is an important source of enduring rebellious grievance in the Arab World. The essay makes this claim through a comparison of fiscal decline and policy response in Jordan and Egypt. Both states have endured fiscal crises and periodic revolt starting in the late 1970s. Both regimes attempted to manage deepening fiscal weakness through similar coping policies, searching for new sources of revenue and revising public spending. These measures failed to reverse the decline. Instead, new sources of revenue and shifts in spending deepened inequality in new ways, lowered capacities to curtail public-private corruption, and entrenched labour insecurity. In other words, it is the politics of fiscal weakness which explain the prominence of socio-economic grievance voiced before, during, and after 2011.

Does family ownership reduce corporate tax avoidance? The moderating effect of audit quality,2017,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the effect of family ownership on corporate tax avoidance. It also investigates whether audit quality affects tax avoidance practices by family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 55 Tunisian listed companies from 2008 to 2013, the authors use GLS regression models estimated with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Findings: The results show that family ownership is positively associated with corporate tax avoidance practices, suggesting that families expropriate minority interests by extracting rents from tax-saving positions. These practices are less prominent after the 2011 Tunisian revolution, suggesting that the pressure from governments and non-governmental organizations against corruption and unethical behavior has increased after the revolution. However, the findings show that audit quality curbs the incentives of family firms to engage in aggressive tax positions, supporting the moderating effect of audit quality on the relation between family ownership and tax avoidance. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that Tunisian family firms are likely to expropriate minority interests by extracting rents from tax-saving positions. However, in presence of high-quality audit, the relation turns negative, suggesting that external audit quality is an efficient corporate governance device that is likely to monitor family corporate decisions. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research by investigating the moderating effect of external audit quality on the relation between tax avoidance and family ownership. It also examines tax avoidance by family firms in a unique setting: Tunisia, a transitioning economy subsequently to the 2011 revolution, where investors’ rights are weakly protected and the financial market is not well-developed as in more developed countries.

By looking at the complex structure of media aid architecture and investigating the practices and programmes implemented by some representative organisations, this article reflects on the field of media development as a new modus operandi of the West (the EU and US especially), to promote democracy through alternative and non-collateral, bottom-up support.

We found that the decline in fertility reversed in 2007, earlier than postulated, plateaued and then increased again in 2013. The increase in TFR coincided with a convergence of fertility rates across education levels, and there is evidence of a shift toward childbearing at younger ages among more educated women, which may be inflating period measures of fertility.

The Ascendance of Official Islams,2017,"This article examines how and why four Arab states, Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, and Egypt, have increased official Islam (OI) to counter the new challenges in the regional environment following the Arab uprisings. It argues that regimes responded to the initial rise of popular Islam as well as the threat from extremist groups by enhancing their support for official Islam. In an effort to control the religious space and legitimize their rule, these regimes have allocated financial resources, political capital, and institutional power to elements of official Islam. Furthermore, these regimes’ survival strategies vary according to the regime type and the presence or absence of inherited religious institutions. For example, we find that Tunisia turned to foreign training of their imams and greater cooperation with religious leaders in other countries. By contrast, Egypt, under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, further coopted al-Azhar and OI by setting the agenda for how religion institutions should engage society. Meanwhile, Jordan continued its long-standing development of OI while Morocco further expanded and internationalized OI. These similar goals but distinct approaches demonstrate the importance of the understanding the context in which these specific policies are developed.

Morocco protest movements in the post-constitutional reform,2017,"The research describes and explains the wave of protest movement in the Kingdom of Morocco, one of the Muslim countries in the Western Arab, in the post-2011 constitutional referendum. The constitutional reform was carried out as a response to the large and massive people protest. Unlike the cases in other neighboring states where ""Arab Spring"" took place, the Moroccan movement receded without neither the fall of the regime nor massive casualties. However, intense protest kept taking place, especially in Muhammad V Street leading to the Parliament Building. Some interesting questions arise, including what the nature of the current protest is and why people still protest after the vast popular agreement toward the constitutional referendum. Based on library research and intense observation for forty days, and interviews, this study found that, to some extent, the Morocco protest has the same nature as that of the Arab Spring. The protest has ""hidden agendas"" although there are evidences that they dissembled in ""smaller and partial issues because of some reasons"". The author holds that Morocco is an important lesson for political reform in the current turbulent Arab world and, to a broader context, in the Muslim world.

The constitutional reform was carried out as a response to the large and massive people protest. Unlike the cases in other neighboring states where ""Arab Spring"" took place, the Moroccan movement receded without neither the fall of the regime nor massive casualties. However, intense protest kept taking place, especially in Muhammad V Street leading to the Parliament Building. Some interesting questions arise, including what the nature of the current protest is and why people still protest after the vast popular agreement toward the constitutional referendum. Based on library research and intense observation for forty days, and interviews, this study found that, to some extent, the Morocco protest has the same nature as that of the Arab Spring. The protest has ""hidden agendas"" although there are evidences that they dissembled in ""smaller and partial issues because of some reasons"". The author holds that Morocco is an important lesson for political reform in the current turbulent Arab world and, to a broader context, in the Muslim world.

"Differences in resource management affects drought vulnerability across the borders between Iraq, Syria, and Turkey",2017,"Much discussion has taken place exploring a potential connection between the 2007–2009 Fertile Crescent drought and Syria's uprising-turned civil war beginning in 2011. This study takes an integrated perspective on the 2007–2009 drought in the border region of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey by looking at the meteorological, agricultural, and socioeconomic aspects of drought vulnerability. Satellite-based precipitation and vegetation data help outline the drought’s spatial and temporal properties. In order to understand the context in which this drought happened, we also look at the trends in vegetation productivity between 2001 and 2015, as well as each country's different politico-economic factors affecting land and water resource management leading up to the drought. The findings show that, although the drought was severe in Syria, it was not the only country affected, nor necessarily the worst hit meteorologically. The agricultural drought lasted 2 yr in most affected areas on the Iraqi and Syrian sides, however, only 1 yr in the affected areas on the Turkish side. The vegetation trend analysis shows a striking difference between the Syrian and Turkish sides of the border. Turkey experienced a general improvement in land productivity between 2001 and 2015, whereas Iraq and Syria show a generally negative productivity trend. The fact that the decline in rainfall had different effects on crops in each of the three countries highlights the role government and private sector resource management and infrastructure play in reducing drought vulnerability. The findings of this study highlight the need for an integrated approach to research that investigates the interconnection between climate and conflict.

"The Determinants of Political Cleavages in Jordan, Tunisia, and Yemen: An Analysis of Political Attitudes Structure in the Arab World",2018,"This article investigates the determinants of political cleavages composing the structure of political attitudes in Jordan, Tunisia, and Yemen following the Arab Spring. Further, it tests whether political cleavages carry predictive weight on ordinary citizens’ electoral choices in general elections. Using the Sixth Wave of the World Values Survey, discriminant analysis was conducted to generate the dimensionality, type, and structure of political attitudes in the three nations. Findings suggest that the structure of political attitudes in Jordan, Tunisia, and Yemen is multidimensional: the Islamic-Secular division, a conflict along economic policy visions and an emerging divisive dimension concerning political reform. Evidence indicates that political cleavages do not possess significant predictive power in determining voters’ choice at elections booths. This research also points to the significance of social transformation processes such as modernization and globalization in causing a shift in values among ordinary citizens in the Arab World. This research argues that in countries where the effects of modernization and globalization are higher, a weakening of the Islamic-Secular division is witnessed. This research is important since it paves the way for further empirical analysis on political ideology in the Middle East. It shatters conjectures concluding that Arab polities are only divided by a single hierarchical dimension: Islamic-Secular. It contributes to comparative research on the dimensionality of political ideology by showing that the Arab World is similar to the industrialized world in the dimensionality, nature, and structuration of political ideology.

State and regime capacity in authoritarian elections: Egypt before the Arab spring,2018,"Scholarship on electoral authoritarianism has increasingly recognized state capacity as an element enhancing electoral control. Building on such arguments, I examine the interaction between state capacity and regime strength in authoritarian elections. Drawing on empirical evidence from Egyptian elections under Mubarak, I show that the degree to which official regime candidates were able to profit from state penetration depended on the strength of the ruling party. In urban settings where party structures were stronger, service provision by the state helped secure the dominance of the hegemonic National Democratic Party; in rural constituencies where the party was weak, by contrast, service provision strengthened local elites who often ran and won against the party’s official candidates. This suggests that variation in regime capacity to channel political support needs to be taken into account when examining the relationship between state capacity and electoral control under authoritarianism.

Still troubled: Tunisia’s youth during and since the revolution of 2011,2017,"This paper presents evidence from interviews in 2015–2016 with a nationally representative sample of Tunisia’s 15–29 year olds. We focus on the sample’s political participation and orientations during the revolution of 2011 and subsequently. We find that just 6.6 percent of those aged 15–24 at the time played any direct part in the ‘events of 2011’. Political engagement then and subsequently is shown to have been influenced most strongly by a university education and growing up in a politically engaged family. In 2015–2016, young people were overwhelmingly pro-democracy, supported equal opportunities and status for the sexes, and endorsed values of self-expression, but attached equal importance to economic security and betterment, felt that their country’s traditions should be maintained and respected, and were personally religious, though three-quarters wanted religion to be kept out of politics and government. Although Tunisia is the sole Arab Spring country to emerge with a still functioning (in 2017) multi-party democracy, we find that in 2015–2016, the majority of young people did not trust their elected politicians.

After the 2011 Arab uprisings, regional instability is being driven by a confluence of three interrelated developments. First, the weakening role of the United States as a power balancer in the Middle East, combined with the larger global context, has provided assumptions about threats and new opportunities for local and other actors to pursue strategic and foreign policy objectives that have deepened tensions and regional competition. Second, there has been a juxtaposing of power multipolarity with ideological multipolarity, itself a source of increased instability, with two of the regional powers, Iran and Saudi Arabia, fanning opposing sectarian flames to further their respective strategic objectives. Third, this strategic competition is being played out in several newly weakened or collapsing states such as Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

Main drivers of economic growth: A sectoral approach to GDP growth in Egypt,2018,"The increasing attention of the Government of Egypt, since the 2011 revolution, to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth has given a renewed stimulus to research on economic growth from a sectoral perspective. In this paper, we investigate the main sectors that drive economic growth in Egypt in various time periods by adopting an econometric modelling strategy. In particular, we attempt to answer the following questions: what are the sectors that led economic growth in Egypt during the high-growth period? Were these sectors resilient to shocks? What are therefore the sectors of high priority that policy makers should direct efforts to in order to achieve sustainable inclusive high growth rates? The findings of the regression model reveal a significant role for both the manufacturing and the agriculture sector in promoting economic growth, with a 1% increase in the output of the manufacturing sector being capable of increasing GDP by 0.17%, while, the same increase in the output of the agriculture sector resulting in an increase in GDP by 0.15%.

From Fitnah to Thaura: The metamorphosis of the arab-muslim protest movements,2017,"Since 2011, the Arab world has entered a period of political turbulence accompanied by widespread growth of protest activity. The events that were metaphorically called the “Arab Spring” referring to the “Spring of Nations” of 1848, affected virtually all countries of the Middle East and North Africa. In Libya, Syria, and Yemen, antigovernment demonstrations led to almost complete destruction of statehood raising the question of the existence of these political entities in their former borders. Egypt and Tunisia ended up with a change in the ruling regimes that repeated many times. The ruling elites of other Arab countries, having experienced the wrath of the Arab streets to varying degrees, managed to stay in power.

Sectarianism and social conformity: Evidence from Egypt,2017,"Why might citizens adopt exaggerated public antagonism toward outgroups? When this is so, how much do public and private attitudes diverge? I argue that expanding exclusionary rhetoric against outgroups can create social pressures that incentivize ordinary citizens to adopt bigoted attitudes to avoid ostracism from their own majority community. Based on an investigation of Egypt during the Arab Spring, I identify the emergence and diffusion of a norm of discrimination against the country’s tiny Shi’a population. Under these conditions, a substantial portion of Sunni citizens adopted and countenanced anti-Shi’a bigotry not because they truly believed it, but rather because they feared the consequences of expressing public support for coexistence. A variety of qualitative evidence traces the growth of anti-Shi’a sentiment during this period, while original survey data show that over 80 percent of Sunni respondents openly expressed anti-Shi’a attitudes. Yet when asked about their attitudes via an item count technique, a method that grants a reprieve from social pressures, the percentage of respondents expressing discriminatory views toward the Shi’a dropped to just over 40 percent. One implication is that sectarian attitudes in the region are as much the product of malleable social and political pressures as deeply rooted preferences.

Police collapse in authoritarian regimes: Lessons from Tunisia,2017,"The quick unraveling of authoritarian systems specifically designed to bear social pressure during revolutions is puzzling. Building on the 2011 Tunisian revolution, this article analyzes the collapse of the police apparatus during the 2011 revolution. In line with Way and Levitsky’s study of authoritarian collapse, this article shows that the low cohesion and low scope of the security forces is one of the main factors explaining the rapid collapse of one of the Arab world’s seemingly most solid repressive systems. At the theoretical level, this article will demonstrate that preference falsification is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can nourish authoritarian resilience. On the other, it can also weaken repressive regimes by making core members of the regime overestimate the loyalty of the low-ranking members of the security apparatus.

Media and the politics of the sacral: freedom of expression in Tunisia after the Arab Uprisings,2017,"In 2011, calls for ‘dignity’ led the mantra for change in the Arab Uprisings. ‘Dégage!’ (‘Clear out!’) was hurled against Tunisia’s President Ben Ali and his fellow Arab dictators’ coercive paradigms that robbed citizens of agency and censored their convictions. During the exceptional politics that ensued, Tunisia’s liberated media exemplified the independence the revolution had achieved. Yet, how free expression was constituted grew increasingly contentious as the media’s lens projected ambiguities in practices surrounding religious and political norms – what Harald Wydra terms ‘sacral symbolisms’ – within the popular imaginary. This implicated interpretations of what was publicly acceptable and dignified and what was not. The media’s engagement with freedom of expression and its significations went through three stages. First, ‘Dégage’, or ‘freedom from’, was celebrated as an erasure of humiliation. The disharmony of competing symbolisms took on new import, however, as the second aspect of constructing dignity, ‘freedom to’, became a contested political and cultural space. Mediation of free expression became a site of power politics and appropriation, creating ‘red lines’ that curtailed certain liberties to secure others, thereby recasting the contention as ‘freedom for whom’. This third stage, in train, remains a realm of mediated uncertainty.

Of Monarchs and Islamists: The ‘Refo-lutionary’ Promise of the PJD Islamists and Regime Control in Morocco,2017,"The article engages the literature on political parties in semi-authoritarian regimes to examine the state and Islamists’ strategies in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab uprisings in Morocco. The pace of state reforms and the regime’s institutional flexibility pre-Arab spring, the cosmetic reforms in the new constitution, and the 2011 legislative elections so far have insulated the Moroccan regime against any meaningful constitutional and institutional changes. However, the electoral contests produced an opportunity for the Islamist Party of Justice and Development (PJD) to enter the Moroccan political scene at the helm of the government. Using extensive field research and interviews with PJD members, I argue that the party is pursuing a pragmatic ‘refolutionary’ strategy within the regime’s constitutional rules of the game, aiming to mitigate the authoritarian features of the government while tackling, with limited success, Morocco’s major socio-economic issues. Ultimately, the regime’s control over the political system continues to influence Moroccan politics. The monarchy has a long tradition of managing opposition parties through cooptation and confinement, allowing opposition parties some stake in power, while the king and the palace’s shadow government of advisers are firmly in control.

Trump's middle east policy making and the future of security,2017,"As it looks at the region, Trump can see three central challenges facing the Middle East, working together to create the horrible brew we're now dealing with. The first challenge is the security vacuums in places like Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen that followed the collapse of some of these Arab republics. These vacuums are highly problematic, setting the conditions for extremism. They are where extremists organize and plan attacks, and where refugees originate. A lot of these destabilizing problems, then affect the entire region. Trump's election is a massive setback for humanitarian issues, in fact, many welcome him, despite his rhetoric on Muslims, women and minorities. Most troubling, however, is that many of U.S questions about his approach to the Middle East cannot be answered right now because he literally has no experience in foreign policy. The international community has no idea what to expect from Trump, and such diplomatic uncertainty is a humbling experience at best. Trump needs to reassure its nation's allies before he becomes president; assurances and commitments are especially crucial when times are tough, as they are now. NATO is important, but so are the Sunni Arab states. Given that one of Trump's few clear aims is to destroy the Islamic State, it is absolutely imperative that Saudi Arabia and similar countries be involved, since the group's ideology cannot be discredited without them. The expectation that ""Trump as president"" will be starkly different from ""Trump as candidate"" is a false hope at best. Saudi Arabia should be ready for some surprises, likely in the form of negative rhetoric from the Trump administration. Ultimately, the kingdom needs to create an alliance of Sunni countries to serve as a bulwark against a potentially anti-Sunni Trump. While Trump has long signaled a desire to get out of the Middle East, candidates often flip positions when they face difficult decisions as president. Yet the ultimate outcome of any given regional crisis will depend heavily on the cabinet members and advisors surrounding him. Whatever the case, given the region's current situation the Palestinians more divided than ever, the Iranians bent on regional expansion, and the Saudis in the midst of a ""revolution disguised as economic reform"" U.S historical allies in Israel and the Sunni Arab countries need a strong America now more than ever.

The analysis is based on a Twitter dataset including 62 million tweets by 7 million unique users. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, we demonstrate how clusters of users form and evolve over time, the density of interactions between them, and the flow of particular types of information through the clustered network structure. We show that the Egyptian Twitter public developed into increasingly isolated clusters of the like-minded which shared information unevenly. We argue that the growing distance between these clusters encouraged political conflict and facilitated the spread of fear and hatred, which ultimately undermined the democratic transition and won popular support for the military coup.

Trickster Defeats the Revolution: Egypt as the Vanguard of the New Authoritarianism,2017,"Egypt’s January 25 Revolution often has been viewed as an explicit contest between the Hosni Mubarak regime and its cronies, who were able to prevail by pulling the levers of a ‘deep state,’ and revolutionaries espousing progressive visions, albeit visions divided between those of Islamists and non-Islamists, and often seen by each as mutually incompatible with the other. The defeat of the January 25 Revolution’s progressive aspirations can be understood, to a substantial degree, as a victory by the old regime. However, revolution understood as a Liminal Crisis allows us to see the rise of ‘Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi not as a straightforward restoration of the old regime, but as both a revolutionary outcome and as an instantiation of a New Authoritarianism that has been making significant strides toward power in the wake of the 2011 revolutions. Liminality is understood here as the intermediate stage in a transition as described in Victor Turner’s Ritual Process and recently reinterpreted in the context of politics by Bjørn Thomassen. The potential dangers of liminality often are controlled by ritual, but this is not the case in revolutions, which become liminal crises precisely because there is no conventionalized means for closing off the state of being in-between. In such circumstances Tricksters—beings at home in liminality and often-elaborated in myth, folklore, and literature—become potentially dangerous in politics. Sisi can be seen as a Trickster politician. But more broadly, the structuring of liminality through the global political-economic order of contemporary capitalism both creates a generalized precarity outside the most elite levels of society, and at the same time predisposes those compelled to live in precarity to be attentive to political Tricksters. Hence liminality can be seen as both the beginning and the end of revolution.

Lock-in effect in the Russian–Libyan economic relations in the post-Arab Spring period,2017,"This paper analyses the impact of Libya’s regime change in the post-Arab Spring period on its economic relations with Russia. It shows the usefulness of path dependence theory as an instrument to explain the rapprochement between the two countries and renewal of their joint projects after the Arab Spring. The paper argues that path-dependent factors related to pre-revolution contracts signed between Russia and the Gaddafi regime in the gas and oil industries, the military sphere, and transportation constrained the ability of Libya’s new political elites to significantly decrease Russia’s economic presence in the country.

On the evolutions of the Arab Spring,2017,"This article looks back at the 2011 Arab Spring where the movements that brought hope to the region and beyond seem to have gone astray. The military has taken over in Egypt, while Libya, Syria and Yemen have descended into civil strife with tremendous human costs. Bahrain has witnessed repression that has overwhelmed the opposition, and while Tunisia, the country where Arab Spring began, has avoided the violence characterizing the aforementioned states, change has remained rather limited. As for other countries that rode on the same wave of mobilizations, hopes for democratic transformation have been subdued in somewhat less violent contexts but with varying degrees of pressure from the state. This article examines what has happened to the Arab Spring countries, why and what is required to democratically transform the region.

Political militaries in popular uprisings: A comparative perspective on the Arab Spring,2017,"What determines whether militaries will defect from authoritarian incumbents during regime crises? Variance in military behavior in the Arab Spring has given rise to a debate around this issue. This article highlights weaknesses of the dominant explanation and develops an alternative account of military behavior in ‘endgame scenarios’. If militaries are politicized institutions that play a major role in regulating access to power under authoritarianism, they are more likely to intervene during normal times, but less likely to defect during mass uprisings. I quantitatively test this argument against data on military coups between 1975 and 2000 drawing on a new variable that allows me to explicitly model the impact of major regime crises. I illustrate the emergence of different forms of political–military relations and their consequences in the Arab Spring by drawing on evidence from Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia.

Radio and political change: listening in contemporary Morocco,2017,"Among the effects of the Arab uprisings on Morocco were the adoption of a new constitution and the emplacement of an Islamist-led coalition government. Despite these significant changes, the internal discussion on democratic change and increased political participation and freedom is ongoing. The media are both one of the major subjects and the forum of this debate. An important development has been the liberalisation of the previously state-controlled radio sector in 2005, with 13 private radio stations having been established in addition to the already existing public stations. As the restructuring of the audiovisual sector is a recent phenomenon, this paper asks how contemporary Moroccan audiences responded: What do they listen to and why? In order to answer this question, fieldwork was conducted for a period of three months, primarily interviewing taxi drivers as a major cohort of radio listeners. In addition, an online survey of students’ listening preferences helped to contrast the taxi-driver findings with those relating to a younger generation. Theoretically, the paper approaches the topic by looking at the ‘uses and gratifications’ theory in an authoritarian context. The findings indicate that newly established private radio stations enjoy wide popularity and thereby are challenging the public stations’ position.

Doing Politics in the Recent Arab Uprisings: Towards a Political Discourse Analysis of the Arab Spring Slogans,2017,"The present paper aims to analyse a number of those slogans collected from the sit-in quarters in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.

Drawing data from several mediums, including banners, wall graffiti, audio-visual instruments, chanting, speeches and songs, this paper tries to show the extent to which the slogans serve as a medium by which political complaints and comments are dispensed and consumed. This paper draws on a rhetorical analysis to find out their persuasive effect on shaping the Arab intellect and on the change of the political atmosphere in the region. Lastly, this paper attempts to show to what extent the slogans meet the standards of political discourse and whether they can be considered as a sub-genre of political discourse or not.

The People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen: Unique Socialist Experiment in The Arab World at a Time of World Revolutionary Fervour,2017,"This essay examines the twenty-three years’ existence of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen in the context of the regional and world Left revolutionary and anticolonial movements of the second half of the twentieth century. The essay first examines the divisions of the liberation movement between followers of Nasserism and those who were influenced by the left wing of the Movement of Arab Nationalists. The 1967 Arab defeat by Israel and the National Liberation Front’s occupation of Aden shortly thereafter were important in finalizing the NLF’s victory over its Nasserist rival. The essay then addresses the internal causes of the series of factional struggles which tore apart the movement (and later its successor, the Yemeni Socialist Party) throughout the PDRY’s existence and assesses the extent to which ideological differences in the world socialist movement influenced these internecine confrontations. The regime’s steadfast solidarity with world revolutionary movements took place at the expense of improved relations with its neighbours, who opposed socialism in any form. Despite its poverty, the regime implemented remarkable social and economic policies which gave its population a welfare state beyond its means; the essay assesses the extent to which this emerged from autochthonous analysis or from external influences from the socialist world or elsewhere. Finally, it hints at some of the reasons why today’s southern separatist movement looks back on this period as a model despite not subscribing to socialism. Throughout, the analysis relates developments and events in the PDRY with relevant events and organizations elsewhere in the Arab world and beyond.

Assessing the High Representative’s Role in Egypt during the Arab Spring,2017,"The 2009 Lisbon Treaty institutionalised an intergovernmental constitution for managing policies traditionally a matter of national sovereignty, such as foreign and defence policies. However, important innovations were introduced in the foreign policymaking structure to limit its intergovernmental logic, in particular, with regard to the role of the High Representative (HR). It was generally assumed that those innovations would have made development of a coherent EU foreign policy possible. Yet, in one of the most significant tests for the EU’s foreign and defence policies in the post-Lisbon era, namely the Egyptian crisis (2011-14), those reforms did not work as expected. Notwithstanding the innovations, the HR’s role was diminished by the European Council’s strict control over foreign policy toward Egypt. The lack of clear policy guidelines towards the issue of democratisation in the Arab world in the 2003 European Security Strategy, although partially mitigated by the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Barcelona Process/Union for the Mediterranean, made it even more difficult for the HR to bring a European perspective into the largely intergovernmental setting.

Fatalism and revolution: expanding our understanding of fatalism during a unique political opening in Egypt,2017,"Fatalism is the belief that major life events are outside of our individual control. We examine two distinct types of fatalism–theological and empirical fatalism–in Egypt during a unique ‘moment of madness’ immediately following the revolution of 2011 when the political system was in upheaval and many thought all things were politically possible. Drawing on a non-proportional quota survey of 136 Egyptian metropolitan adults in the midst of the 2012 Egyptian Presidential elections, we find that empirical fatalism (belief that fate controls) and theological fatalism (belief that an omniscient God controls) are uncorrelated and have quite distinct social correlates and implications for protest action. Empirical fatalism is tied to being older and female and is a significant deterrent to protest potential. Theological fatalism, which is more widespread, is stronger among the less educated and men but has no effects on protest potential. In contrast with arguments about the anti-modernism of Islamic beliefs, Muslims in general and the more intensely religious Muslims are less likely to be empirically fatalistic. Our results suggest that, at least in Egypt, there are at least two distinct types of fatalism and, while empirical fatalism discourages protests, theological fatalism does not. We discuss the implications of these findings for the further study of fatalism and its impact on political and social action.

A comparison of suicidal behavior by burns five years before and five years after the 2011 Tunisian Revolution,2017,"Introduction In Tunisia, the phenomenon of self-immolation has increased dramatically since the self-burn of Mohamed Bouazizi which occurred on 17 December 2010. The aim of our study was to compare the casualties’ profile of suicide by self-immolation before and after the Tunisian Revolution over a period of 10 years (2006–2015). Methods We conducted a retrospective review including all the cases of self-immolation suicides that occurred in Northern Tunisia five years before and five years after the January 2011 Revolution. We excluded cases of self-immolations committed in governorates other than the north of Tunisia as well as casualties of accidental or criminal burns and those where the context could evoke suicidal immolation but the self-inflicted nature has not been confirmed. The study sample was subdivided in two groups according to the Revolution date: before the Revolution (2006–2010) and after the Revolution (2011–2015). We compared for each group data related to the age, gender, marital status, employment, mental disease history, previous suicide attempts and threats, place of suicide and its motive, the type of fire accelerator, the hospitalization and the average body surface area burned. Results The number (n = 48/24.5% before 2011) of suicide by self-immolation has tripled during the post-revolution period (2011–2015) with a stable trend. The average age (35.6 ± 13.4) has not changed. The male remained predominant before and after the Revolution (sex ratio of respectively 1.67 and 3.23). Marital status (victims being single in n = 81 cases/41.3%) and the employment (unemployed in n = 128/65.3%) of the casualties have not changed either after 2011. Fewer cases with psychiatric history were reported (n = 21/43.7% before against n = 52/35.1% after). Self-immolation increased in public places (n = 9/18.7% before against n = 50/33.8% after) and in an administration (n = 2/4.2% before against n = 19/12.8% after). More suicides after 2011 were due to financial problems (n = 2/4.2% before against n = 30/20.3% after) or due to a conflict with a state representative (n = 2/4.2% before against n = 18/12.2% after) with fewer cases due to a decompensation of mental illness (n = 18/37.5% before against n = 22/26.4% after). Conclusion Our study highlighted modifications of the casualties’ profile of self-immolation after the Tunisian Revolution represented essentially by less psychiatric history and more suicides occurring in public places and in front of public administrations as well as suicides motivated by financial problems or conflicts with a state representative.

Drawing on sustained fieldwork conducted by one of the authors in the aftermath of the Arab Spring in both these countries, and inspired by a mid-twentieth century intellectual legacy emerging in and from the Maghreb, the essay proposes an “other thinking” (pensée autre) capable of refiguring the Europe–Maghreb relation beyond the stalemate offered by ENPI. Such a rethinking, it is argued, would consider more explicitly the presence of political Islam as a vector of economic development in ways that restage the Euro-Maghreb as a postcolonial horizon rather than a fixed border between self-sufficient geopolitical entities.

"Post-Islamism and fields of contention after the Arab Spring: feminism, Salafism and the revolutionary youth",2017,"In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, conflicts in Egypt and Tunisia over the authority to rule and the role of religion in society raised questions about these societies’ capacity for reconciling differences. In retrospect, the conflicts also raise questions about the theoretical tools used to analyse regional developments. In particular, the ‘post-Islamism’ thesis has significantly changed the debates on ‘Islam and democracy’ by bringing to light the changing opportunity structures, and changed goals, of Islamist movements. However, this paper argues that the theory underestimates differences within post-Islamist societies. Drawing on field theory, the paper shows how the actual content of post-Islamism is contingent on political struggle. It focuses on three fields whose political roles have been underestimated or misrepresented by post-Islamist theorists: Islamic feminism, Salafist-jihadism and the revolutionary youth. Their respective forms of capital–sources of legitimacy and social recognition–give important clues for understanding the stakes of the conflicts after the Arab Spring.

The nonlinearity of the new Keynesian Phillips curve: The case of Tunisia,2017,"This article seeks to check the nonlinearity of the Phillips curve in Tunisia for the 1993–2012 period, relying on a hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve modeled via a Logistic Smooth Transition Regression (LSTR) model with endogenous variables. We estimate this model using the nonlinear instrumental variables. The empirical results corroborate the new Keynesian assumption ofprice rigidity and show that the response of inflation to the output gap tends to be significant only if the inflation rate tends to be relatively high and exceeds a certain threshold. For a low inflation rate, the price rigidity dominates. This result is particularly evident in Tunisia, especially for the years following the 2011 revolution during which the elasticity of inflation rate to an excess demand has become highly important and the inflation rate experienced record levels. ","The nonlinearity of the new Keynesian Phillips curve: The case of Tunisia This article seeks to check the nonlinearity of the Phillips curve in Tunisia for the 1993–2012 period, relying on a hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve modeled via a Logistic Smooth Transition Regression (LSTR) model with endogenous variables. We estimate this model using the nonlinear instrumental variables. The empirical results corroborate the new Keynesian assumption ofprice rigidity and show that the response of inflation to the output gap tends to be significant only if the inflation rate tends to be relatively high and exceeds a certain threshold.

This result is particularly evident in Tunisia, especially for the years following the 2011 revolution during which the elasticity of inflation rate to an excess demand has become highly important and the inflation rate experienced record levels.

The Coptic diaspora and the status of the Coptic minority in Egypt,2017,"This paper examines the political activity of the Coptic diaspora in the United States in support of the Coptic minority in Egypt. Analysing its strategy reveals that for years it has focused on lobbying the United States and international bodies, in order to raise international awareness of the Coptic minority status. By using this strategy, it has framed the struggle for Copts’ rights in a manner that contradicts the Egyptian unity narrative, and the strategic choices of those they are struggling for. This paper shows that understanding the limitations of this strategy alongside a change in the structure of opportunities in Egypt has led to a change in the pattern of activity of the diaspora activists. Alongside lobbying for international involvement, they have developed additional strategies, including strengthening their influence in the homeland and even direct action vis-à-vis the Egyptian authorities. This paper, which emphasises the pattern of action of diaspora activists that represent minorities, directs attention to the structure of opportunities in the homeland, the variety of relationships between the diaspora and the homeland, and their effect on the ability of the diaspora activists to become a significant force in shaping the life of the minority.

"The smell of blood: Accumulation by dispossession, resistance and the language of populist uprising in Syria",2017,"This paper is about how the Syrian government lost control over its rural and rural-to-urban constituents. From the twin perspective of ethnography and political economy, I show how the same pressures that structured men’s decisions to migrate from the countryside to sell labour power in the city resemble the material foundations for the uprising itself. The dominant narrative of the Syrian uprising is that protests calling for democracy were suppressed with violence, and with that the movement degraded into a sectarian civil and proxy war. Contra this narrative, I describe from a moment of cynicism expressed toward the Baʿth party’s official slogan how the government once relied not only on the ‘repressive apparatus of the state’, but also a politico-economic system that guarded against total impoverishment. Following liberalising reforms in the 1990s—deepened in the 2000s—this arrangement crumbled; agricultural input subsidies were stripped; food price capping was removed; guaranteed pricing on crops was cancelled; and import barriers fell. In attempting to answer challenges thrown up by Syria’s position within global capitalism, the government abandoned its welfare pact. In a context rapidly determined by accumulation by dispossession and mass impoverishment, Syria’s marginalised population vocalised chains of what Ernesto Laclau (2005. On Populist Reason. London: Verso) would recognise as ‘populist demands’. These demands were refused or responded to via transparent propaganda. Against a backdrop of uprisings across the Arab world, the Baʿth party’s remaining thread of a social contract snapped.

A generation of resistance,2017,"Over the last few years in Egypt, female cartoonists have ventured into the traditionally male-dominated arena of political cartoons. For the first time, a group of female cartoonists has emerged, and is expressing its opinions about global, local, and female-related issues. This article discusses the works of young Egyptian female cartoonists and some of the initiatives in which they have participated. I explore their works as sites of resistance that challenge the power hierarchies within the patriarchal structure in post-revolution era Egypt. I use Karl Mannheim’s concept of generation style to suggest that their works will have long-term ramifications for the political scene in Egypt over the coming years. For, in spite of the aborted revolution, a young generation is still carving space that resists the dominant masculine structure in an effort to re-sculpt notions of equity in terms that appropriately reflect the gendered interests of women.

New Asymmetries in the New Authoritarianism: Research in Egypt in the Age of Post-Revolution,2017,"Egypt was at the center of a wave of uprisings and revolutions that swept the region between 2011 and 2013, the common denominator of which was demands for a radical democratic alternative to authoritarian regimes variously formulated around social justice and political rights. While the Middle East was a major theater of these events, with Tunisia, Egypt, Lybia, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen sharing the headlines, the processes that informed these uprisings were also deeply global. The year 2011 was a revolutionary year, maybe the last in history, when actors differently positioned in the neoliberal social landscape mobilized in different ways, from the Occupy Movement to the London riots. The demise, or better, defeat, of these movements has reverberated profoundly around the globe, highlighting the postdemocratic nature of governance in contemporary states. One of the effects of the rise of new authoritarianism across Europe and the United States is a palpable transformation in the asymmetry between outside observer and the local observed. Researchers now face a reshaping, in some ways a leveling, of differences between us and them and the distinct temporality used to underpin this asymmetry. Nothing could illustrate this better than the fact that as I write, Egypt's president 'Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi is enjoying a warm welcome in the White House. The narrative is no longer framed through the worn-out trope of an Arab leader aspiring to modernize his country through pledging allegiance to the leader of the Free World in exchange for aid and armaments; now the man in the White House implicitly pledges to learn from the Arab dictator.

Critical Geopolitics and the Framing of the Arab Spring Through Late-Night Humor*,2017,"Objective: The role of popular culture, particularly humor, is of increasing importance in critical geopolitics and international relations scholarship. This article examines how humor is used to frame the events described as the Arab Spring and U.S. government response. Methods: Sifting through the jokes for references to places, events, and significant actors, the selected jokes were interpreted through critical discourse analysis to identify the themes invoked by the comedians. Results: The Arab Spring countries most mentioned were Libya, Egypt, and Syria. The majority of the jokes about these can best be understood through the lens of incongruity theory and the exploitation of extant caricatures of leaders. Additionally, the jokes reflected concerns over U.S. actions in the region and, simultaneously, U.S. leadership's seeming inability to craft a coherent plan to address the events. Conclusions: We establish the link to humor and geopolitical imagination noting that the themes of American policy, American leadership, regional corruption, and caricatures of leaders composed many of the jokes, reflecting a particular worldview of the region as intractable.

Searching a Political Solution for Syria,2017,"Syria’s sudden plunge into civil struggle is directly linked with United States’ Middle East policy. The 2011 pull-out of American troops from the smouldering provinces of Iraq and the subsequent refusal of the US to take sides in the ‘Arab Spring’ have weakened the incumbent governments and produced too many unsuitable civil claimants to rule ‘Arab Spring’-affected countries. The so-called US neutrality left a vacuum, which was filled by a swarm of Islamist extremists. The resultant internecine wars sparked by contending parties in Iraq, Syria and Yemen had taken these countries to the very verge of chaos. The outcome among other things included a revival of al-Qaeda, which was soon eclipsed by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and an unending spiral of civil war in Syria, the major result of the anti-Western blowback. This article argues that the fight against extremist forces in Syria is doomed if there is absence of a strong, functional and acceptable government. Lasting peace under President Bashar al-Assad looks impossible but it is essential to have the core of Ba’athist regime in place in any transitional or post-transition mechanism. A new interpretation of political solution is required. Else, the state will collapse, which will only help the jihadists. Despite its limitations and challenges, federalisation of Syria and the establishment of a federal structure of the government, it seems, is the only viable solution.

"The identity struggle within Islam: Discussion of “Thoughts on the inner conflict within Islamic culture: Their existential anxieties and ours,” by Malcolm Owen Slavin, PhD",2017,"There is nothing more fitting, the author believes, than for psychoanalysts to help our nations better understand the identity struggle that he believes underlies the radicalization process of radical Islamists. This identity struggle is a very deep one. At its core, it concerns what an individual Muslim feels about his or her bonds to the nation-state and what single cause in their life they are willing to die for. In this article, this struggle is characterized as theo-political and Islamo-national. In order to understand this better as psychoanalysts, the importance of the personal narrative–this sense of how an individual’s identity fits and meshes with the world around them–is stressed. To that end, this article will first given an introduction to the author and his family, and then bring readers to the Arab Awakening, which began in 2011. Dr. Slavin’s paper on Tunisia has highlighted so many of the elements of the changes that transformed Tunisia and some of the substrate that led to that evolution; this article provides the context both regionally and, more importantly, within the Muslim consciousness. The author describes the lens through which he was raised in Wisconsin as a devout Muslim and the son of Syrian political refugees. This then overlays an understanding of what was really happening across the revolutions of the Arab Awakening against tyranny and in the global consciousness of individual Muslims.

Hiring and Separation Rates Before and after the Arab Spring in the Tunisian Labour Market,2017,"We seek to explore the hiring and separation rates in Tunisia before and after the Arab Spring based on quarterly business level data for 503 firms over the span of January 2007 to December 2012. Furthermore, we examine whether employers are willing to dismiss older workers to trigger an effective increase in mobility that will open new opportunities for the youth community. We build our analysis upon six main empirical models to study employment decisions reflected by major indicators such as the number of hiring, number of separations, total employment effects, male-female ratio, age cohorts, labour mobility and net employment. The results show that the Arab Spring has created structural unemployment trends. In addition, we note that the 2008 global turmoil has fostered the firing level of employment. Our conclusions also indicate that the response of Tunisia's government to high unemployment rates caused by the financial meltdown in 2008 and the events in 2011 was not sufficient to remove the attached lingering effects that still distress the country's labour market. In addition, our findings emphasize the significant challenges faced by Tunisian youth that could be mitigated by efficient policy actions to incentivize training and development geared towards the private sector.

However, the definitive death of this mechanism occurred when Iraq was uprising against the existing semi-armed state and tried to redefine its position by changing the structure and dividing the power of the regional system. At that time, the Islamic Republic of Iran, neither could nor wanted to play the role of a control mechanism in the regional system.

Thus, formation of a coalition by major western powers for the liberation of Kuwait, the control mechanism that worked in shadows during the years after the 70s and only came to the scene at times of crisis and when the regional system was at risk played the role of regulating the equations and relations of the Persian Gulf region.

Sidelined by design: Egypt’s parliament in transition,2017,"Egypt’s parliament has been broadly excluded from the country’s political developments since the 2011 uprisings.

Subsequently, no parliament existed until new elections, repeatedly postponed, were eventually conducted in fall 2015. This delay seemed to be part of the government’s strategy, as it used these years without a parliament to draft an electoral law that made formation of a legislature critical of the regime highly unlikely.

Oil and intra-state conflict in Iraq and Syria: sub-state actors and challenges for Turkey’s energy security,2017,"The continuing dependency on fossil fuels of the Middle East not only in Turkey's energy mix but also in world energy demand requires further analysis of oil and conflict in the region since the fall of Mosul in Iraq to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in June 2014. This article addresses the relationship between oil and conflict.

The exploitation of women and social change in the writing of Nawal El-Saadawi,2017,"Nawal El-Saadawi is an Egyptian writer, a physician by education, who dedicated her life to promote gender equality. She is an activist writer, and the only one in Egypt who point out the connection of women's sexual oppression to women's social and political oppression. She boldly pursues women rights, and demands to change the status and image of the Arabic woman. Her writings include novels, studies and educated scholastic articles, focusing on the oppression and exploitation of the Arabic women, particularly customary rules imposed on women in rural Egypt relying on religion, tradition and the regime. Her writings keep the issue alive. The books and articles of Saadawi enraged the political and religious authorities in Egypt, which led to an official ban on her books. In 1981 conservative Egyptian authorities caved into the pressure of powerful circles in society considering her a threat to the social order, and arrested her to satisfy these circles. Her writings had and still have a tremendous impact on the Arab younger generation especially since she always claimed that social processes are caused and led by those who recognize injustice and have the will and the drive to change things. This article aims to contribute to the present discourse within Arabic society in the wake of the Arab Spring, about the future of the society and the state, through analysis and reflection on the issues raised in the novels of Nawal El-Saadawi illuminating the connection between religion, politics and sexual exploitation. The paper emphasizes the oppression and exploitation of Arabic women through gender discrimination, social inferiority, sexual oppression, girls' circumcision (Khitan), sexual exploitation, and rape. It is important to point out that Saadawi, more than many intellectuals interested in various aspects of social injustice, emphasizes physical and emotional needs, alongside the obvious discrimination in education and employment.

Are banks effective in the economic recovery from the Arab Spring?,2017,"We analyze the role of banks in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen, pre- and post-revolution, and find that the volume of credit they offered to the private sector was neutral to real economic growth. Supported by a recent IMF study which ranks banking regulation and supervision ‘poor’ or ‘below-average’ in four out of the five countries under study, we attribute the limited effectiveness of their banks to government intervention in credit allocation and pricing. Our results cast doubt on the banks’ ability to facilitate an economic recovery, and suggest that a monetary policy focused on bank credit alone may not be successful.

Protest movements and social media: Morocco’s february 20 movement,2017,"Historically, Morocco experienced large-scale political repression during the 1970s through the early 1990s. Through its actions, the regime repressed any claims aimed at challenging its authoritarian configuration of public space. Ironically, with the emergence of the ‘February 20’ movement, those claims were brought back again on to the political agenda. Born in the context of the Arab Spring, February 20 acquired legitimacy both nationally and regionally. Its use of civic and political forms of expression in order to conquer the social arena reflects not only a certain inefficiency of traditional representative bodies (political parties, official media and parliament) but also a relative emergency to convey their message. The leading technological means of communication used by the movement are Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and blogs. The young used these tools not only to promote the movement per se, but also to facilitate its operational organization by informing policy makers, activists and even supporters of the movement nation-wide. This article tries to assess the extent to which the social media platforms utilized by the February 20 movement were a political game changer for a generation eager for freedom and change after decades of oppression in Morocco.

Tracing the development of the Tunisian 1956 code of personal status,2017,"Tunisia has a unique set of family law codes that continue to operate from 1956 to the present day. The 1956 Code of Personal Status deals with crucial issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, alimony, child custody and adoption. The enactment of this code and Tunisian women's emancipation and its uniqueness in the Arab Muslim world can be attributed to a combination of various historical, political and social factors: the country's 'so-called' homogeneity, its particular colonial experience, and above all the country's modernization policy implemented by Tunisia's first president Habib Bourguiba. This article focuses on the early years of independence and the role played by Tunisia's first president in implementing those laws benefitting women and the society at large. It examines the Code, its prominence for the modern independent Tunisian society and the historical trajectory which led to its enactment. This article also focuses on the role played by early Tunisian intellectuals and social reformers who paved the way for the significant amendment of Islamic family laws, the enactment of the Code of Personal Status (The CPS) and the later construction of the post-colonial modern nation-state. The article investigates the radical attempt to modernize and reinterpret the Sharia jurisdiction through a rereading of this new set of laws as they came in Majallat Al-Ahwal Al Shakhsiya (The CPS) in an attempt to better understand the context in which it was promulgated and the reasons accounting for its success. The article utilizes a few secondary sources which document and scrutinize the roots of Tunisia's trajectory towards the advancement of women's causes. Throughout the analysis, I re-examine the code itself to better comprehend the newly promulgated civic rights and obligations granted to women by this revolutionary legal document.

"The Rise and Demise of the Middle East Quest for Reforms, 2011–2017",2017,"Six years have passed since Arab masses in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen revolted against oppressive, corrupt, and autocratic regimes. These and lesser revolts in Morocco and Jordan — as well as muted ones in the oil producing Gulf States — shared common goals and themes: justice, dignity, economic, political, and social reforms (el-Gingihy,). The revolutionaries wanted to end government bloating and oppressive bureaucracies; and political and massive public corruption by the ruling classes; and instead, involve citizens in the participation in governance and policymaking. The oil-rich countries were quick to shower their nationals with salary bonuses and more generous subsidies. The poorer Arab countries were quick to unleash their violent security forces on the masses in order to quell the uprisings using brute military force, including using poison gas in Syria, and operating mass killings of demonstrators at Rab‘a Square in Cairo, Egypt. With the exception of Tunisia, the rest of the Arab countries reverted to oppressive regimes, or civil war chaos, as was the case in Libya and Yemen. The United States, which hailed the Arab uprisings during the reign of the Obama Administration, has changed course under the isolationist Trump Administration, which looks upon all Arabs and Muslim people and nations as potential supporters of what the current administration labels as Muslim terrorism. Along with an analysis of events in the region, this article also reviews the most recent books published which deal with the Arab revolts, and which include what lies ahead for the Arab world under the new rulers who replaced old regimes. It will also analyze the Arab countries’ response to a Trump Administration that seems to adopt political isolationism, while at the same time, showing an obvious inclination for personal and national business involvement in the region, such as the recent opening of a Trump golf course in the United Arab Emirates, and the appointment of former MOBIL CEO Executive Rex Tillerson, who has strong business ties with Russia and the oil-producing Gulf States.

The mechanisms of stagflation in Egypt:The arab spring five years later,2017,"This study addresses the economic performance of the Egyptian economy during the periods before and after the 25th January upheaval in 2011. It analyses, in particular, the extent to which monetary and fiscal policies contribute to the phenomenon of stagflation in Egypt after 2011. The study adopts Gordon’s (1977 & 1985) model in specifying the relationship between inflation, unemployment, and real GDP growth. SVAR model has been employed to determine the factors behind stagflation in Egypt. The results suggest that macroeconomic performance does not significantly change during the periods before and after the 2011 and stagflation occurs in Egypt through the following mechanisms; (i) the existence of excess demand in the commodity market in conjunction with the existence of structural unemployment in the labor market. (ii) An existing mutual relationship between inflation and unemployment where both inflation and unemployment feed each other through the wage-price spiral and the elevation of the cost of production triggered by domestic currency depreciations. (iii) The subordination of monetary policy to fiscal policy which is in line with the fiscal dominance hypothesis and crowding out effect. (iv) Expected higher rates of inflation, through the expectations channel, shifting Phillips curve upwards.

This research is based on ethnographic fieldwork and ordinary language interviews conducted in the United States, and semi-structured, open-ended interviews with Syrians in Germany and Turkey.

Managing contention: Divergent government responses to youth protests in the Arab world,2017,"Why do some authoritarian governments respond beneficently to political protest while others opt for repression? This article argues that beneficent government responses in the form of concessions or institutional inclusion are fostered by three interrelated mechanisms working at three distinct levels: institutionalization of political protest within the polity, external certification of protest demands by legally legitimized authorities, and interest polarization between protesting groups and the government. Empirical comparison of government responses to youth protests before and during the 2011 uprisings in Morocco and Egypt proves that the divergent strategies in the two countries were not the result of spontaneous decision-making in times of heightened regime contention. Rather, they mirror established patterns of protest politics that are relatively resistant to ad-hoc manipulations.

The impact of foreign equity flows on market volatility during politically tranquil and turbulent times: The Egyptian experience,2017,"Since the popular uprising of January 2011, a series of momentous events has rocked Egypt's political order, jeopardising the country's economic and financial stability. This study examines the role of foreign capital flows in the volatility of the Egyptian equity market, and whether this role has changed due to the recent domestic political unrest. These issues are empirically addressed in the context of GMM estimation. The results suggest that, unlike those of foreign individual investors, trades of foreign institutional investors contribute to market fluctuations, whether prior to or following the January 2011 uprising. Sell trades by foreign individual and institutional investors exert a significant influence on volatility. Further, when volume is split into its anticipated and unanticipated components, the results show that surprises in trading activity by either group tend to exacerbate volatility in periods of calm and turmoil. These findings are broadly insensitive to volatility measures and robust, even after controlling for a variety of relevant determinants of market volatility. The evidence documented in this study provides important implications for policy markers.

Beyond Money and Diplomacy: Regional Policies of Saudi Arabia and UAE after the Arab Spring,2017,"The post-Arab Spring context created a window of opportunity for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to reposition themselves in the region as countries capable of using not only money and diplomacy, but also military means in pursuing their regional policies.

The Saudi State as an Identity Racketeer,2017,"Although substantial research has examined the Saudi state’s symbiosis with the Islamic revivalist movement commonly known as ‘Wahhabism’, few studies have considered how the dynamics of state formation underpin this relationship. This article argues that a continuous and circular political logic lies behind the Saudi state’s patronage of the revivalist movement since 1744 and proposes a four-stage model that explains how and why the regime has maintained its support for the revivalist movement over such a prolonged period. This article first outlines the model, then presents a detailed analysis of its persistent presence in the development of Saudi state authority in order to highlight the recurrent manner by which the state often has constructed the spiritual concerns of revivalists to counter challenges to its authority, a pattern demonstrated most recently during the Arab Spring and the war in Yemen. The effects of this model will continue to shape the decisions, policies and perceptions of the Saudi political elite for the foreseeable future.

Between social contention and takfirism: the evolution of the Salafi-jihadi movement in Tunisia,2017,"This article analyses the evolution of the international jihadi movement during the Arab uprisings. It is based on the case study of Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia, which emerged in 2011 and disappeared in 2013, after it went through a process of failed institutionalization. I argue that, under certain circumstances, the jihadi movement can be institutionalized, i.e. transformed into a radical social movement in which violence is an undesirable option. In analysing the Tunisian case, I examine the ideology and social practices of the movement, showing how within the jihadi movement there coexists two tendencies: a social-political movement (social and popular consensus/ nationally based/ political strategy of the Islamic front) and a takfiri tendency (apocalyptic/ internationalist/ non-compromising). I finally use Hafez’s political process approach to show how the prevailing of one tendency over another depends on political opportunities.

These are part of an emerging electronic Coptic diaspora (e-diaspora)—a form of borderless territoriality—that functions to compensate for the loss of territorial and socio-religious-cultural-political control in Egypt and provide Copts with virtual territorial gains and borderless space for community and consciousness raising.

"Security sector reform, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of militias: the challenges for state building in Libya",2017,"Even though the rebels, later turned ‘revolutionaries’, actually had an insignificant role as combatants in the violent downfall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in 2011, they became involved in acts of war in many parts of the country in what came to resemble a civil war. Their militias flourished thanks to the lucrative financial handouts that governments paid to them. To complicate matters, additional militias sprang up in the absence of any sort of viable state/institutional control on the part of the nascent ‘state’ or an inability to restrict and monopolize the use of force. Therefore, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and security sector reform have not been possible, and the Libyan case demonstrates the failure to emulate international best practices, thus hindering any state-building. This paper seeks to analyse the Libyan case and provide an approach and framework for dealing with the genuine causes of the current situation in order help put the appropriate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and security sector reform (SSR) policy in place, while simultaneously not ignoring other major, contributing factors. This study suggests that the case of Libya is unique and likely to prove challenging to both established and evolving theoretical approaches to both DDR and SSR. Experiments in the country that have ignored the holistic security sector reform will be examined and its programmes analysed to ascertain whether these have produced any effective state-run structures and mechanisms, norms and procedures, or whether they have only served to reinforce the de facto roles of militias. The article argues that unless the state-building approach is revitalized and national reconciliation made a top priority, Libya’s current debacle and instability is most likely to continue.

Through an examination of the regime’s political liberalization strategy, leadership failures within women’s organizations, and international donor influence on programmatic focus, the underlying explanation for this failure is found to be rooted in the historical depoliticization of women in Jordan.

Ctrl-alt-revolt?: Online and offline networks during the 2011 Egyptian uprising,2017,"Analyses of the 2011 Egyptian uprising assign a significant mobilizing role to the interpersonal networks created through Facebook and Twitter. However, these studies fail to investigate online networks in comparison with more traditional ""offline"" networks, which are similarly theorized to mobilize members to protest participation. In this pa-per, we analyze nationally representative Arab Barometer survey data from Egypt 2011 to compare the mobilizing effects of memberships in four different types of networks: online, union, community, and religious. We test whether these networks were distinct and operated in competition, or overlapping and operated in tandem to mobilize Egyptians to protest. We demonstrate that different networks mobilized different segments of the population, consistent with theories about the negative revolutionary coalition necessary for successful uprisings. We also show that multiple network membership increases protest propensity, and that individuals at the intersection of online networks and community group networks, such as those formed through membership in charity groups or sports clubs, are most likely to engage in revolutionary protest. These results speak to an important interactive effect between online and offline networks in terms of facilitating successful revolutionary uprisings.

Social determinants of contraceptive use in Tunisia; [Les déterminants sociaux de l'utilisation des méthodes contraceptives en Tunisie],2017,"Background In Tunisia, the “Revolution” of January 2011 highlighted significant regional disparities and social inequalities in access to health care, including reproductive health services. The purpose of this study was to analyze the social determinants of the use of contraception in Tunisia. Methods A cross-sectional national study conducted in 2012; on a sample of 15 to 49-year married women (n = 4374) drawn by a two levels random sampling. Prevalence of contraception and its association factors were assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the variation of contraception prevalence with area of residence, age, level of education, number of children and household income. Results The prevalence of contraception was 66.4 %. Eighty-two percent of women used a modern contraceptive method. The use of contraceptive methods was significantly dependent on the age (P < 0.001), area of residence (P = 0.008), education (P < 0.001). The prevalence of contraception was higher in North West (OR = 1.1 [0.81–1.5]; P < 0.001), among multiparous women (OR = 4.49 [3.57–5.66]; P < 0.001), among the youngest women (OR = 1.4 [0.9–2,19]; P < 0.001) and among those with higher levels of education (OR = 1.62 [1.19–2.21]; P = 0.008).

The impact of Basel II on the banking strategies in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region,2017,"In the last two decades, regulators have increased their focus on the capital adequacy of banking institutions in order to enhance the stability of the financial system. A major step in that direction are minimal risk- = based capital requirements for banks, referred to as the Basel II Accord. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which bank capital regulation, measured by Basel II implementation, has affected the willingness of banks to lend or invest in other assets. This study differs from past ones in that it uses a cross-section time series data set spanning annual observations covering 1997-2013 for individual banks in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. In general, the results provide clear support for an increase in credit growth following the implementation of capital regulations. Despite higher capital adequacy ratios, banks extended lending and grew assets, including their holding of government securities. Credit growth appears to reflect demand instabilities ascribed to real growth, cost of borrowing and exchange rate risk. Generally, macroeconomic variables, in contrast to capital adequacy, seem to prevail in predicting credit growth, irrespective of the capital sufficiency.

Addressing travel writers’ role as risk brokers: the case of Jordan,2017,"Recent international events such as Brussels bombing and the terrorist attacks in Paris have stressed the importance of issues related to terrorism, personal safety, and instability on tourism. Jordan, as a major tourism destination in the Middle East, is relatively safe. However, its tourism industry has been negatively impacted by the political instability and the constant occurrence of on-going geopolitical crises in the Middle East region. One of the main strategies to respond to this challenge is to invite western travel writers to experience Jordan and to promote the destination via travel articles. Thus, using Jordan as the case, the purpose of this study was to examine the representation of Jordan as a travel destination within travel media and to discuss travel writers’ roles as risk brokers during unstable times. A qualitative framing analysis was conducted on travel feature articles published in five national newspapers from five countries (US, Canada, UK, New Zealand, and Australia) over a 10-year period. Results of the analysis revealed that Jordan was framed as a typical heritage tourism destination, with natural and cultural resources featured. Findings further revealed that safety emerges as one of the major issues that contemporary travel articles were concerned about. Based on the findings, travel writers’ role as risk brokers was addressed. The article also discussed the importance for tourism policy-makers to emphasize risk management during unstable times.

Iran and Turkey: not quite enemies but less than friends,2017,"The rise and subsequent erosion of friendly relations between Iran and Turkey was a result of their regional ambitions. While Turkey had long seen its secular system as presenting an alternative to Iran’s Islamic ideology, the alignment of their regional interests facilitated a rapport between the two states in the first decade of the twenty-first century. However, the Arab Spring proved divisive for this relationship as each state sought to advocate its model of government and secure a leadership role in the Arab world. The war in Syria widened the divide, as Iran’s long-standing support for the Bashar al-Assad regime could not be reconciled with Turkey’s desire to see President Assad out of office. Using a close reading of Persian and Turkish sources, the authors will analyse the Iran–Turkey divide, focusing specifically on how the Iranians have portrayed it as a clash of civilisations, citing Turkey’s so-called ‘neo-Ottoman’ ambitions as the primary cause.

How can we measure progress on social justice in health care? The case of Egypt,2017,"Social justice, broadly defined as providing equal access to liberties, rights, and opportunities especially for the least advantaged members of society, is a priority of several governments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) post-Arab Spring as well as globally. Achieving social justice in the field of health care is consistent with the principles of universal health coverage and is an important means to achieve this aim. To translate this abstract concept into concrete action, we propose a novel diagnostic method and then apply it to the case of Egypt, a country with a stated goal of achieving social justice in health care. This allows us to assess progress and then suggest targeted recommendations through which to improve social justice in health care. Through a comprehensive analysis of primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative data sources, we first identify six disadvantaged groups in Egypt and then analyze the status of these groups with respect to the three objectives of a health system—improving health outcomes, financial protection, and public satisfaction. Our results suggest that Egypt faces 11 challenges to achieving social justice in health care that can be addressed through 14 short-and medium-term recommendations drawn from global evidence of what works. Implementing these health system changes can help advance social justice in health care in Egypt. ","How can we measure progress on social justice in health care?

Political reform in Jordan: Reality and aspirations,2017,"This article offers a comprehensive review of the process of political reform in Jordan under the reign of King Hussein and King Abdullah II from 1989 to the present. It also identifies obstacles to political reform. Main findings include that political reform in Jordan is an old and popular demand, and that the process of political reform in the country has made some achievements. However, these achievements have not been enough to push real and lasting reforms forward. The study presents a number of policy recommendations. The most notable concern is the need for further constitutional amendments to consolidate the democratic principle of “sovereignty of the people,” reduce the executive authority’s access to other authorities, and reconsider the laws governing political life, to build a state ruled by law and institutions, to establish a society of justice and equality, and to overcome the instabilities manifested in the Arab Spring.

"Exploring Collaborative Civic Leadership Among Young Tunisians: Inviting Despair, Creating Hope",2017,"This article explores how civically engaged youth in Tunisia are approaching collaboration with noncivically engaged youth to promote greater levels of civic participation. This article is based on qualitative research conducted in Tunis, Tunisia during the summer of 2015 with 16 youth, all under the age of 35. This article will explore youth attitudes regarding civic engagement and barriers to participation in postauthoritarian Tunisia. This article also explores how civically engaged youth utilize informal social spaces such as coffee shops, universities, and social media sites to stir a sense of hope and pride in activism. This research provides a rich snapshot of civically and noncivically engaged youth who comprise 51% of Tunisia's population and led the 2011 revolution that burgeoned the so-called Arab Spring in North Africa and the Middle East. These findings bring into question labels such as “politically inactive” and “potential ISIS fighters” that are employed in the dominant narrative on Tunisian youth. Finally, this research suggests that Tunisian youth wield powerful leadership skills that will continue to play a critical role in the transformation of civic and social norms.

The impact of the ouster of president morsi on the political-religious attitudes of Egyptian citizens,2017,"While conducting a survey in Egypt in the summer of 2013, we were interrupted by the ouster of President Morsi, but continued afterward, resulting in a unique sample set. With these data, we were able to investigate, with a quasi-experimental design, the impact of the ouster, a major turning point in the Egyptian revolution, on the attitudes of Egyptians regarding political participation, the role of religion in politics, and Islamist ideology. After the ouster, overall willingness to participate in politics, whether in form of demonstrations, voting, or strikes, declined. Regarding the role of religion in politics, participants favored less involvement of religion in politics after the ouster. The attitude towards jihadism facet of Islamist ideology changed slightly from strong disagreement to disagreement. Besides the ouster, a factor generally affecting the political attitudes was education: the more highly educated individuals were the more willingness they showed to become politically active. Another factor was the general religious orientation: the more religious individuals were the more important for them was religion for politics. However, the religious orientation had no effect on the attitude towards Islamist ideology.

Al-Qaida's complex balancing act in Syria,2017,"Over the years, al-Qaida has become an increasingly decentralized movement in which its geographically dispersed affiliates have assumed increasing levels of autonomy over their tactical and strategic decision-making. At the outset of the Arab Spring, al-Qaida was also undergoing a process of strategic rethinking, in which more locallysensitive and nationally grounded methods of operating were being encouraged as more effective paths towards durable jihadi projects. The Arab Spring itself also presented al-Qaida and its affiliates with opportunities to tie themselves more deeply into a collective sense of change across the Middle East. It was in Syria that this evolved level of thinking found itself most efficiently realized, as Jabhat al-Nusra sought to implement a modus operandi that was based on integrating and embedding itself into the Syrian revolutionary milieu through a combination of cooperation and [short-term] pragmatism. Jabhat al-Nusra's embrace of this new model of jihad brought it substantial benefits, but as time passed, it also posed new challenges. By embracing localism so wholeheartedly over al-Qaida's traditional internationalist agenda, Jabhat al-Nusra struggled to sustain the trust of its members who expected a truly fundamentalist face to eventually emerge. Moreover, despite its strong localist focus, too many Syrians still distrusted the group because of its continued links to a globalist jihadist movement. Jabhat al-Nusra therefore sought to differentiate itself from ISIS and was also forced to distance itself from al-Qaida, which set in motion a series of events that challenged the group's successors' - Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) and Hayat Tahrir al- Sham (HTS) - internal unity and external credibility. It therefore appears that although HTS in 2017 maintains a potentially protectable base in northwestern Syria, the challenges that its unique strategy presented forced it to act in ways that undermined much of the sustainability progress it had made in previous years. Whether the group's long game strategy of controlled pragmatism could be said to have been a success is therefore an open question.","Al-Qaida's complex balancing act in Syria Over the years, al-Qaida has become an increasingly decentralized movement in which its geographically dispersed affiliates have assumed increasing levels of autonomy over their tactical and strategic decision-making.

For a second human capital variable – secondary education – the results indicate a positive and significant relationship with happiness in pre-Arab Spring Egypt, while that relationship for post-Arab Spring Egypt is negative and significant.

Media use by young Tunisians during the 2011 revolution vs 2014 elections,2017,"Citizen participation is a key factor in open government and a fundamental form of collective problem solving in democratic societies. Citizens need reliable information to support collective sense making and decision-making. During crises, such as political uprisings and controversial elections, reliable information sources are essential for citizens to stay informed and make sense of rapidly changing developments. In countries that exert control over media, citizens try to access alternative information sources, such as unfiltered Internet and social media. Using two rounds of surveys with young, educated adults in Tunisia, we examined their use of diverse information sources during the 2011 revolution. We update these findings with a third survey round asking similar questions to young, educated Tunisian adults' about their use of diverse information sources during the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Our results show there have been dramatic changes in the use and perceptions of the reliability of broadcast media as Tunisia builds a new government with more open participation and national communication media. The Internet and social media still play an important role in informing the Tunisian public, but new government and private sources are perceived as significantly more reliable than they were under the authoritarian regime overthrown by the 2011 revolution. Our election survey results show that higher perceptions of information reliability, along with the sharing of online information, lead to greater political information efficacy (PIE).

From revolution to elections. A comparative analysis of Tunisia and Egypt,2017,"Political participation is far from being a trivial issue. The focus of this paper will be on two dissimilar acts of political participation in the context of the Arab Spring: revolution and elections. In detail, I will first describe participants in revolution and elections - who they are and why they do participate - to then analyse the link (if any) between revolution and electoral participation. This study will develop a comparison between the cases of Tunisia and Egypt. The findings will illustrate that Tunisian insurgents are more likely to vote in post-revolution elections when compared to their Egyptian fellows, and that this is consistent with the events in the aftermath of the two revolutions.

How violence breeds violence: Micro-dynamics and reciprocity of violent interaction in the Arab uprisings,2017,"This article builds on the recent trend of analyzing violent interaction through visual data, but goes one step further than existing research studying the emergence of violence by investigating the micro-dynamics of how violence evolves. The article applies micro-sociological analysis of video material from the uprisings in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Syria as well as interviews with activists, opposition politicians, and journalists from the three countries. The material supports Randall Collins’s (2008) argument that the emergence of violence is constrained by particular situational circumstances where the perpetrator is able to dominate the victim and/or to avoid direct contact with the victim. However, contrary to what one might expect if emotional domination precedes violence, this does not mean that attacks are rarely followed by counter violence. Rather, this article argues that violence is often reciprocal with parties mirroring each other in action-reaction sequences. Hence, violence can be considered a form of interaction ritual in its own right – a dance-like sequence – initially inhibited by the human tendency to fall into each other’s rhythms, but once initiated promoted by exactly that tendency.

A semiotic analysis of political cartoons in Jordan in light of the Arab Spring,2017,"This paper provides a semiotic analysis of political cartoons published in Jordan prior to and during the 2013 elections. It seeks to depict the sociopolitical context after the 2011 Arab Spring and focuses on the changes to people's practices and stances toward politics and politicians. The data consist of political cartoons by the Jordanian cartoonist Imad Hajjaj drawn during the parliamentary election campaigns in 2007, 2010, and 2013. This paper argues that the humor generated in cartoons conveys strong messages that require an analysis of the interaction between the different signs in cartoons and their social and ideological implications. A model of analysis derived from Barthes' perception of denotation and connotation theories is adopted. This model is comprised of three types of messages: linguistic, literal, and symbolic. The analysis identifies different messages in the cartoons before and after 2011. Unlike the cartoons from 2007 to 2010, the linguistic and denoted messages in the cartoons of 2013 connoted a sense of salvation, achievement, victory, freedom, dignity, and democracy, merits that had rarely been highlighted in previous cartoons. This attitude is reflected by themes such as the positive image of the young, public awareness of political and national issues, and resistance towards corruption. The study sheds light on this neglected area of visual communication in the Arab world and hopes to provide new insights into the fields of semiotics, pragmatics, multimodal analysis, and critical discourse analysis.

Repression and Monarchical Resilience in the Arab Gulf States,2017,"Why the uprisings that broke out across the Middle East and North Africa in 2010-11 ousted the leaders of republics but left monarchies largely intact remains puzzling. One promising explanation for the resilience of monarchical regimes argues that monarchs exercise repression in a comparatively restrained and largely effective fashion. Proponents of this theory tend to conflate two crucial causal factors: the level of state coercion exercised against opposition activists and the degree of indiscriminateness with which coercion is deployed. By treating these variables as analytically distinct, a more compelling explanation for monarchical resilience can be advanced. The advantages of the revised argument are illustrated by revisiting the divergent trajectories of the uprisings in Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

How does civil conflict influence gender equality? A case study of the Egyptian Revolution 2011–2013,2016,"Analyzing the changes to gender equality in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, this manuscript evaluates whether civil conflict creates new openings for women’s empowerment. Recently, the literature has considered civil conflict a potentially powerful, transformative force in women’s social and political inclusion. Given Egypt’s comparatively low performance in gender equality achievements and policies, the 2011 Revolution creates a critical opportunity to evaluate the transformative power of conflict. The analysis shows that the Egyptian revolution was transformative of legislation on behalf of women’s physical security; women saw gains emerge in this area of legislation from processes connected to the revolution. Pre and post-test, qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest that the key mechanism through which such transformation occurred was the strengthening of the local women’s movement. This is demonstrated through a critical analysis of the various mechanisms of change highlighted in the growing literature on conflict and gender equality. However, the analysis also reveals that the lack of women’s formal representation and the seizure of power by Islamic forces contributed to setbacks that inhibited further-reaching change during the transition.

It examines international mediation attempts by states, non-governmental organisation, and regional and international organisations. Drawing largely on Bercovitch and Gartner’s framework of mediation outcomes, the study suggests that the directive strategy applied by Staffan de Mistura through the United Nations–Arab League joint effort has achieved the closest outcome towards a full settlement. Mediation in the Syrian crisis has been limited by disagreement among key actors, lack of commitment and of coordinated efforts, questions of representation and legitimacy, and lack of neutrality and of inclusiveness. Despite its limits, mediation has been able to achieve important gains such as the longest and broadest ceasefire, access to the majority of besieged areas, considerable de-escalation of violence, commitment among key actors towards a resolution, and resolution of incidents of hostage crises. Despite its limits, mediation is likely to play an important role vis-à-vis the Arab Spring.

While each has a different focus, they share a number of common themes: the tension between the individual and the collective, the intersection of gender with class as a site of disenfranchisement, the effects of a politically oppressive environment on the autonomy of the physical body, and the way strategies of control effect the lived experience of urban space. Based upon the strongly voiced critique embedded in these texts, the writers’ notable positions within their own local literary contexts, and the neglect to which their work has been subject in the West and larger Arab world, I ultimately argue for more inclusive reading practices in modern Arabic literature.

Al-Qaeda’s grievances in context: reconciling sharia and society,2016,"At a time when political debate in the West is preoccupied with the perceived impact of extremist ideas on individuals who embrace or support terrorism, this article uses the publicly articulated grievances of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda’s most prolific ideologue, as a case study to examine how a globally focused and distributed extremist narrative matches political realities on the ground. The approach of the article is to compare two political processes: the approach of Islamist extremists, as represented by Zawahiri, to constitutional reform as articulated through public appeals to potential supporters versus the reality of constitutional amendments and evolution of fundamental law in the Middle East and South Asia. Incorporating insights from studies on law and society and International Relations, the article demonstrates how Zawahiri’s interpretation of religious law emphasises wholesale adoption of sharia while the process of legal reform has invariably resulted in the creation of legal hybrids, mixing Islamic and non-Islamic legal traditions. This is not an article about theology or religious law but an effort to dissect the public relations of an international terrorist movement. The analysis pays particular attention to events in Zawahiri’s native Egypt, where evolving grievances concerning a series of constitutional amendments – including those following the Arab revolutions and the toppling of Mohammed Morsi – are assessed.

Incorporating insights from studies on law and society and International Relations, the article demonstrates how Zawahiri’s interpretation of religious law emphasises wholesale adoption of sharia while the process of legal reform has invariably resulted in the creation of legal hybrids, mixing Islamic and non-Islamic legal traditions. This is not an article about theology or religious law but an effort to dissect the public relations of an international terrorist movement. The analysis pays particular attention to events in Zawahiri’s native Egypt, where evolving grievances concerning a series of constitutional amendments – including those following the Arab revolutions and the toppling of Mohammed Morsi – are assessed.

Nomadic taxonomy: How the Bedouin lost his poetry,2016,"In the years following General Gordon’s violent demise in 1885, the British public was inundated with cultural, anthropological, and journalistic depictions of no-madic religious groups in the Middle East. Beginning with an examination of the sympa-thetic proximity between Orientalist explorer and nomadic native in the first half of the nineteenth century, this essay shows how the explorers’ valorization of the nomads’ ability to evade enumeration and taxonomization shifted following uprisings in Egypt in 1881. Parliamentary debates, newspaper reports, and imperial melodramas helped create the new figure of the Bedouin criminal. Late imperialism, normally understood as the accel-eration of forces of mobility and cosmopolitan rootlessness, is thus read here as a move-ment equally invested in compulsory sedentarization.

Abd al-Rahīm Kamal's Dahsha: An upper Egyptian Lear,2016,"This article investigates the pivotal cultural and socio-political issues affecting Egyptian society that 'Abd al-Rahīm Kamāl, a young Egyptian scriptwriter, represents in his television series Dahsha (Perplexity, 2014). This Saldī (Upper Egyptian) adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear raises issues including widespread and grinding poverty, the marginalization of women, the stigma attached to illegitimate children, and the continuing dependence upon patriarchal leadership, with Egypt's 2011 revolution hovering in the background. Kamāl's divergences from Shakespeare's play in terms of characterization and plot create a different, culturally oriented interpretation of Lear. The article also examines the effects of transposing Lear from the stage into a different medium - the television screen. Finally, it distinguishes between the two literary concepts of 'adaptation' and 'proximization' by analysing how Egyptian audiences and critics responded to the series.

"Cinematic Terrorism: Deleuze, ISIS and Delirium",2016,"This paper will use the concept of time-image discussed by Gille Deleuze in Cinema 1 and Cinema 2 as a heuristic tool for thinking about the Internet films of the Islamic State (ISIS). By considering that ISIS films primarily operate on two different axes: a time-image that presents a recollection of a mythic past, and a movement-image that reverses roles of power and sovereignty with a Western antagonist through mimesis, I discover that although we are unable to consider the ISIS films strictly as documentary, they are nonetheless not representational either. Within this context, I will argue that ISIS films may be experienced as actualizations of a global schizophrenic delirium. The ISIS films demonstrate what Deleuze describes as the “powers of the false.” They show a reality that is unbearable to witness. In the same way that the Marquis de Sade exhibited in life and fiction a physical violence and perversion that were symptomatic of the chaotic and brutal realities of the French Revolution, ISIS itself, and not only its film productions, becomes the foci of a symptomatic and cinematic realization of the failures of our globalized society in the post-Cold War/Arab Spring era. We experience the unbearable violence in the form of schizophrenic delirium, as if this violence is being performed somewhere else, by someone else, to someone else. These forms of spatial and temporal shifts, detachments, and interchanges are emphasized by the arrival of war refugees to the Western world from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

"Ambiguities of student activism, authoritarianism and democratic attitudes: the cases of Egypt and Morocco",2017,"This article is concerned with exploring the political attitudes of a microcosm of university students, in Egypt and Morocco, which present two different case studies in the Arab world. The first, a republic which faced mass demonstrations and regime breakdown during the Arab Uprisings, and the second, a monarchy which faced mass demonstrations that were quickly contained through various authoritarian upgrading measures by the monarch. The research is based on analysing two survey studies conducted in various universities during the period from December 2012 until February 2013. The study found that young activists are most likely to be young men who are members of political parties. They believe in some procedural aspects of democracy, such as voting. Egyptian activists believe that democracy is more important than security, unlike the rest of the sample in Egypt and Morocco. However, Egyptian and Moroccan activists’ attitudes towards equality, freedoms and tolerance are more traditional and conforming with conservative social attitudes in their polities at large. This presents an ambiguous relationship between activists and democracy in authoritarian regimes, which needs further analysis.

Geographies of external voting: the Tunisian elections abroad since the 2011 Uprising,2016,"This contribution draws on the developing literature on the participation of citizens’ abroad in elections of their country of origin. It looks at Tunisia as a case study. Although it focuses on a single case study, this paper is comparative to the extent that it puts the case of Tunisia in perspective with other cases from the literature, and that it discusses the influence of different settings on the voter turnout and the voting behaviour of the Tunisians abroad. By doing so, it shows how Tunisian specificities contribute to academic discussions on the diffusion of new citizenship norms in the age of globalization and on the extent to which migration contributes to political change in labour sending countries. The paper first explores the adoption of external voting provisions by the former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali as soon as 1988, and the extension of external voting rights after the 2011 Uprising. The paper further adopts a geographic, diachronic, and multi-level approach to analyse the voter turnout and the voting behaviour among the Tunisians abroad since 2011. Results first show that the adoption and implementation of external voting in Tunisia is closely articulated to domestic processes of political change, regardless of the type of regime (authoritarian or democratic). Furthermore, results show that the voting behaviour of the Tunisians abroad follows the same trends than their Tunisian counterparts, but that it varies significantly depending on their place of residence (country, city, and neighbourhood). Such observation challenges the idea according to which migrants socialised with liberal values in Western societies tend to promote such values in their homeland. In contrast, this paper argues that the voter turnout and the voting behaviour in external elections depend on pre-migration variables and on the local context in which migrants are embedded.

The atassis of homs: The rise and decline of one of Syria’s founding families,2016,"This brief collective biography offers a starting point for understanding how notable families struggled to adapt to shifting bases for authority in the twentieth century. The Atassi family, relative to most notable families in post-Ottoman Syria, maintained wealth and influence by transcending the traditional basis for authority associated with the “politics of notables.” For instance, it was an advantage to be a notable Sunni Arab family associated with the Hashemites in the 1920s through the 1940s, but it was a disadvantage in the era of Arab Socialism starting in the mid-1950s. Several Atassis maintained positions in government as advocates of a law-based political system, but were eventually sidelined as the new state descended into crisis, and military priorities and radical ideologies took over. Later, in the era of the minoritarian Assad dynasty (1970–present), the family was seen as a political threat. While some of the Atassis went into exile, others continued to play key roles in the Syrian private professional sphere. Since 2011, a few prominent Atassis have joined the ranks of the stalwart opposition to Bashar al-Assad.

"Characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated at Tripoli Medical Center, Libya, between 2008 and 2014",2016,"Bacterial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represent a well-known public health problem affecting both healthcare-associated and community populations. Past studies have clearly shown the value of characterizing problem organisms including MRSA through the use of molecular techniques (i.e. strain typing), with the aim of informing local, regional and national efforts in epidemiological analysis and infection control. The country of Libya represents a challenge for such analysis due to limited historical infectious disease information and major political unrest culminating in the Libyan Civil War (Libyan Revolution) in 2011. A MRSA study population of 202 isolates, cultured from patients in Tripoli Medical Center through this historical period (2008-2014), was characterized by both phenotypic and molecular methods. The results revealed a diversification of epidemic MRSA strains over time with generally increasing resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The study identified prevalent MRSA in comparison to known global epidemic types, providing unique insight into the change of strains and/or characteristics over time especially with reference to the potential influence of the political revolution (i.e. pre-and post-2011).

A Macroscopic Analysis of News Content in Twitter,2016,"Previous literature has considered the relevance of Twitter to journalism, for example as a tool for reporters to collect information and for organizations to disseminate news to the public. We consider the reciprocal perspective, carrying out a survey of news media-related content within Twitter. Using a random sample of 1.8 billion tweets over four months in 2014, we look at the distribution of activity across news media and the relative dominance of certain news organizations in terms of relative share of content, the Twitter behavior of news media, the hashtags used in news content versus Twitter as a whole, and the proportion of Twitter activity that is news media-related. We find a small but consistent proportion of Twitter is news media-related (0.8 percent by volume); that news media-related tweets focus on a different set of hashtags than Twitter as a whole, with some hashtags such as those of countries of conflict (Arab Spring countries, Ukraine) reaching over 15 percent of tweets being news media-related; and we find that news organizations’ accounts, across all major organizations, largely use Twitter as a professionalized, one-way communication medium to promote their own reporting. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, we also examine how the proportion of news content varies across topics within 100,000 #Egypt tweets, finding that the relative proportion of news media-related tweets varies vastly across different subtopics. Over-time analysis reveals that news media were among the earliest adopters of certain #Egypt subtopics, providing a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for influence.

Comparative political economy of the IMF arrangements after the Arab uprisings: Egypt and Tunisia,2016,"In the post-uprising period, while Tunisia was relatively successful in its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which provided it with a stand-by agreement in the amount of $1.74 billion, Egypt remained far from reaching any agreement. In an attempt to explain the difference between the IMF experiments in the two countries, that is, the factors leading to the signing of an agreement with the IMF or the inability to do so, this article proposes two arguments, based upon one positive and one negative factor: (1) distinctive domestic political dynamics and (2) the availability of alternative resources. In the two cases, the article argues that the IMF experiment was more successful in Tunisia because Tunisia enjoyed a more suitable domestic political environment which promoted and enabled reforms and thus enabled the negotiations with the IMF. Tunisia also lacked alternative resources that could be used as substitutes for the IMF loan. On the other hand, the IMF negotiations were not successful in Egypt as mounting social and political opposition decreased the ability of the government to maintain economic reforms and negotiate an IMF loan and the existence of alternative resources created disincentives. Furthermore, not only pointing out the importance of ‘alternative funds’ and the ‘domestic political environment’ with regard to the demand side of the IMF loans, this article also debates the relative strengths of the variables, and argues that alternative funds matter more than the domestic political environment.

Will there be Malaysia spring? A comparative assessment on social movements,2017,"Arab Spring was within the premonition because the Middle-east had been a place of contestation since the birth of Judaism and Christianity. Arab Spring caught the attention of the world when the mass movements trumpeting the voice calling for equal rights led to the downfall of dictators in several countries. These countries are labelled as Muslim countries which include Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, Morocco, Jordan and Oman. Some of them experienced less volatile changes. The question is does Malaysia that labelled as a Muslim country will experience such surged by the masses like the Arab spring or will there be Malaysia spring? This paper examines this possibility through several factors such as socio-economic position, the role of the state, history and social structure, and the media in influencing the political awareness of the masses. Although neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand appear to have similar uprising, the results of mass movement in those countries have brought about different results. The concept of hegemony and political awareness are explained in this study. The findings indicate that there is a slim possibility of Malaysia spring due to the aforementioned factors.

Given the social impact of the large number of individuals applying for asylum across Europe in 2015, it is important to study who these persons are in terms of their skills, motivations, and intentions. DiPAS (Displaced Persons in Austria Survey) aims to uncover the socio-demographic characteristics of the persons seeking refuge who arrived in Austria in 2015, mainly originating from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Particular focus is on human capital, attitudes and values. This survey, the first of its kind in Austria and possibly in Europe, was carried out among adult displaced persons, mostly residing in Vienna, yielding 514 completed interviews. Information gathered on spouses and children allows for the analysis of 972 persons living in Austria, and of further 419 partners and children abroad. Results indicate that the surveyed population comprised mainly young families with children, particularly those coming from Syria and Iraq. Their educational level is high compared with the average level in their country of origin. A vast majority of respondents are Muslims, rating their religiosity at medium levels. Judging from stated attitudes towards gender equity, interviewed men seem to have more liberal attitudes than their compatriots. The majority of respondents do not intend to return to their home countries, mostly because of the perception of permanent threat. DiPAS provides data for political decision-making and the on-going societal dialogue. Its findings can help to inform assessments about the integration potential of the displaced population into the host society. In addition, the applied methodological technique and experiences during the fieldwork provide valuable insights on sampling asylum seekers and refugees in the current European context.

(2) It aims to initiate a dialogue for a more precise distinction between various ideational and behavioral components of the concept of culture, since these components do not necessarily fit well together. Considering these two caveats, the article operationalizes culture in the given case to examine some limitations of the nativist ideological perception of cultural zones and its concurrent claims over true nativity. The paper seeks these limitations, first, by analyzing the extent of cultural commonalities between three sub-regional Islamist movements that shared a strong common identity, and second, by examining the dialogue between ideological mismatches in the constitution-making processes of Egypt and Tunisia.","On the borders of cultural relativism, nativism, and international society: A promotion of islamist democracy in the middle east after the Arab uprisings This article focuses on post-Arab-uprising calls for democratization in the Middle East.

"Health in times of uncertainty in the eastern Mediterranean region, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013",2016,"Background The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world.

","Health in times of uncertainty in the eastern Mediterranean region, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Background The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world.

Arab socialism and ecumenical tendencies in Egypt 1962-1970,2016,"During the 1960s in Egypt, a group of intellectuals and publicists with left-leaning tendencies sought to base their socialist views on Islamic principles by reading early Islamic history as a repository of heroes and villains to fit their model of Arab socialist society. Beyond political aggrandizement of Nasserism, this article claims that these intellectuals described Islam as socialist, which led them in unexpected directions. First and foremost, such study led several to make surprising claims regarding the leaders of early Islam that ipso facto brought them closer to the Shi’i view of this formative period of Islam. Rather than merely translating socialism into Islamic terminology, these scholars imbued early Islamic history with fresh and revolutionary meaning. The process of making Islam more relevant to twentieth-century Muslims meant re-examining age-old rivalries, which had the potential to change the relations between Sunni and Shi’i Islam dramatically.

Trust and tolerance across the Middle East and North Africa: A comparative perspective on the impact of the arab uprisings,2017,"The protests that swept the Arab Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are expected to have influenced two key civic attitudes fundamental to well-functioning democracies: trust and tolerance. However, systematic comparative assessments of the general patterns and particularities in this region are rare. This contribution theorizes the uprisings’ impact and presents new society-level measurements of trust and tolerance for the MENA, synchronizing over 40 Arab Barometer and World Values Survey surveys on Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia, and Yemen, from before and after the uprisings. The analyses firstly show political-institutional trust falling in the uprisings’ aftermath in countries that went through democratic reform or regime change. It appears that politicians misbehaving and reforms not resolving social problems hurt people’s trust in politics. Secondly, in democratic transition countries Egypt and Tunisia, a decrease in social trust reflected the pattern of political-institutional trust indicating a spill-over effect. Thirdly, ethnoreligious tolerance dropped region-wide after the uprisings, indicating that the aftermath of religious conflict impacted the entire Arab region. These results support rational-choice institutionalist theories, while at the same time refining them for the MENA context.

Postrevolutionary land encroachments in Cairo: Rhizomatic urban space making and the line of flight from illegality,2016,"After the January 2011 revolution, new and unpermitted constructions on previously empty land went up across Cairo at striking speed. This paper explores a case of such land encroachments carried out by waste collectors in the neighbourhood of Manshiet Nasser in Cairo, Egypt. It begins with theoretical debates about the production of urban space, arguing that the de Certeauian paradigm, in which urban marginals poach or hijack others' spaces evanescently, fails to account for the way such encroachments produce permanent new spaces rhizomatically alongside the pre-existing order. The paper then turns to a close examination of the events in Manshiet Nasser. Although in a broad view the actors are marginals living in the ‘informal’ city, the conditions enabling the encroachments were such that only the wealthiest and most powerful members of the ‘community’ benefitted. In a context of generalized ‘illegality’, the squatters rely on practical norms and de facto recognitions to obtain some degree of tenure security. Since these efforts rely on and play off legal norms even as the squatters violate them, the paper argues that property rights in this context should be understood not in classificatory terms based on the legal/illegal binary, but rather through a trajectory of ‘becoming-legal’: a ‘line of flight’ that approaches legality asymptotically.

The effect of Omani-Iranian relations on the security of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries after the Arab Spring,2016,"This research paper focuses on Gulf–Iran relations within the framework of the bilateral relationship between Oman and Iran. This relationship is unique as well as distinct from Oman’s relations with the other nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has a direct influence on Gulf regional security. Oman’s relationship with Iran has grown stronger and firmer after the events of the Arab Spring. This comes at a time when the Gulf countries are suffering worsening internal security, political and economic conditions and disagree amongst themselves about how to deal with Iran. Hence, the Omani-Iranian rapprochement is intensifying the security anxieties of the GCC countries. This paper examines the conceptual frameworks for security and cooperation within the GCC. Oman’s view on security and cooperation is seen in its foreign policy which adheres to non-intervention and neutrality in foreign affairs. Omani-Iranian relations are analyzed in how they affect Gulf integration and the role played by Oman in the Iranian nuclear deal. The paper concludes by discussing Oman’s position on the current conflict in Yemen and its effect on Gulf security as well as Oman’s role in mediation between the parties in the conflict.

Enhancing Need Satisfaction to Reduce Psychological Distress in Syrian Refugees,2016,"Objective: Becoming a refugee is a potent risk factor for indicators of psychological distress such as depression, generalized stress, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), though research into this vulnerable population has been scant, with even less work focusing on interventions. The current study applied principles from self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan and Deci, 2000) to develop and test an intervention aimed at increasing need-satisfying experiences in refugees of Syrian civil unrest. Method: Forty-one refugees who fled Syria during the past 24 months and resettled in Jordan participated in the study and were randomly assigned to receive the intervention or a neutral comparison. Results: The 1-week-long intervention alleviated some of the need frustration likely associated with refugee status, a major aim of the intervention, and also lowered refugees' self-reported symptoms of depression and generalized stress as compared to the comparison condition, though it did not reduce symptoms of PTSD. Conclusions: Discussion focuses on how these findings speak to the universal importance of need satisfaction for mental health, and how need-satisfying experiences can help buffer against the profound stress of being a refugee. Avenues for longer-term or more intensive interventions that may target more severe outcomes of refugee experiences, such as PTSD symptoms, are also discussed.

Assessing the influence of the Responsibility to Protect on the UN Security Council during the Arab Spring,2016,"This article challenges those perspectives which assert first, that the Security Council’s engagement with the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) during the Arab Spring evidences a generally positive trend, and second, that the response to the Arab Spring, particularly Syria, highlights the need for veto restraint. With respect to the first point, the evidence presented in this article suggests that the manner in which R2P has been employed by the Security Council during this period evidences three key trends: first, a willingness to invoke R2P only in the context of Pillar I; second, a pronounced lack of consensus surrounding Pillar III; and third, the persistent prioritisation of national interests over humanitarian concerns. With respect to veto restraint, this article argues that there is no evidence that this idea will have any significant impact on decision-making at the Security Council; the Council’s response to the Arab Spring suggests that national interests continue to trump humanitarian need.

In all four cases, religious tensions had once figured prominently, yet were safely transcended by the actions of multiple leaders via mutual ideological and religious accommodations, negotiated socioeconomic pacts, and unprecedented political cooperation.

Shifting journalistic roles in democratic transitions: Lessons from Egypt,2016,"While in the case of the Arab Spring the focus of research and debate was very much on the role of social media in enabling political change both during the uprisings and in their immediate aftermath, the impact of traditional national mass media and journalism on framing this political change has been less addressed. In this article, we investigate the role of Egyptian journalists in shaping Egypt's complex and fast-moving political transition. Based on a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews and a conceptual framework building on Christians et al.'s normative roles of the media, it can be concluded that the monitorial and facilitative roles, which were prevalent in the early stages of the post-Mubarak era, were quickly overturned in favor of a radical and collaborative role. Egyptian journalists working in private media thus demonized their political adversaries, mainly the Islamists, transforming this political 'other' into the ultimate enemy. At the same time, the new military regime was being revered and celebrated. This arguably contributed to further destabilize the fragile transition to democracy. It is furthermore concluded that for democracy to succeed in an Egyptian context, antagonistic political conflicts need to be transformed into agonistic ones both at the level of political culture and media culture.

Mass claims in land and property following the arab spring: Lessons from Yemen,2016,"The Arab Spring uprisings have released a flood of land and property conflicts, brought about by decades of autocratic rule. Expropriations, corruption, poor performance of the rule of law, patronage and sectarian discrimination built up a wide variety of land and property transgressions over approximately 30 years. The result has been the creation of longstanding, acute grievances among large components of national populations who now seek to act on them. If new, transitional or reforming governments and their international partners fail to effectively attend to such grievances, the populations concerned may act on them in ways that detract from stability. This article critiques the case of Yemen, whose transitional government, with international support, initiated a land and property mass claims process in the South in order to address a primary grievance of the southern population as part of the National Dialogue transition. A series of techniques are described that would greatly improve the mass claims process once it inevitably recommences after the Houthi conflict comes to an end. These improvements would attach more importance to socio-political realities and how to quickly attend to them, as opposed to an over-reliance on specific legalities. Such an approach could have wider utility among Arab Spring states seeking to address similar land and property grievances.

After the Arab Spring erupted in Libya and Syria, other countries did not exhaust reasonable efforts to deal and negotiate with the incumbent powers, and to assist and encourage them to meet their obligations under R2P, even though negotiations are part and parcel of the R2P framework and constitute the very first step to be taken whenever a state seems to ignore its obligations under that framework.

French and Spanish colonial policy in North Africa: Revisiting the Kabyle and Berber myth,2016,"The French colonial presence in North Africa gave rise to a view that was founded on attributing certain - supposedly distinctive - qualities to the Kabyle people (Algeria) and the Berber people in general (Algeria and Morocco). This became known as ""the Kabyle (or Berber) myth"" and was propagated both by North African nationalists and by the academic world in order to validate their accusations against the colonial powers of practicing a ""divide and conquer"" policy. What's more, from the outset, the French and Spanish colonial governments, by empowering Arabic as an imperial and dominant language to the detriment of the peripheral and low prestige Berber languages, greatly contributed to the widespread acceptance of a further myth, i. e., North Africa was ""Arab and Muslim"". These myths then became a key argument used by the post-colonial governments to deny the distinctiveness of the Kabyle people, and Berbers in general, hence justifying rejecting their demands for linguistic and cultural recognition. In recent years, however, the Berber people have reacted to these myths; we have witnessed the birth of a resistance movement, the uprising in Algeria (Kabylie) and the development of cultural pride and identity. Surprisingly, these events have caused us to reflect anew on the Berber myths of the colonial period.

Credit scoring in the service of entrepreneurship in morocco: Pragmatic approach for the selection of promising projects,2016,"The different policies adopted at the national and international level aimed at investing in the youth to accelerate their development on all socio-economic, political and cultural sectors.

However, lack of direction and support needed to fully contribute to the development of their communities, this potential can turn into frustration, as demonstrated by the ""Arab Spring"".

The ontological (In)security of similarity wahhabism versus islamism in Saudi foreign policy,2016,"It has long been argued that identity matters in international relations. Yet how identity impacts enmity and conflict among states remains the subject of debate. The existing literature asserts that differences in identity can be a source of conflict, whereas convergence and similarity lead to cooperation. Nevertheless, empirical evidence from the Middle East has long defied this hypothesis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which prides itself on being an Islamic model and claims Islamic leadership, has opposed the rise to power of Islamist movements in the Middle East. To address this paradox, this article builds on the growing literature on ontological security to propose a theoretical framework explaining how similarity can generate anxiety and identity risks. This framework, I argue, moves beyond traditional regime security approaches to reveal that security is not only physical but also ontological. I then illustrate the argument through a comparison of Saudi identity risks in the wake of the Iranian revolution (1979) and the ascendance of the Muslim Brotherhood to power in Egypt (2012). Ultimately, these cases provide intriguing insights into foreign policy behavior during critical situations.

From Constructive Ambiguity to Harmonious Interpretation: Religion-Related Provisions in the Tunisian Constitution,2016,"In the wake of social movements that have started almost 5 years ago, citizens across North Africa have protested for the end of authoritarian leadership and demanded constitutional reforms. In a region where hopes fostered by the Arab Spring have ended in civil war, stagnation, and new forms of dictatorship, Tunisia—despite all the challenges it still faces—gives the appearance of an island of relative stability. Its inclusive and participatory constitution-building process was remarkable, overcoming political divisions in a highly divided National Constituent Assembly and successfully ending in an agreement on a compromise text, adopted in January 2014. However, the new constitution was heavily criticized by some analysts, claiming that a number of its provisions were considered irreconcilable and contradictory, notably those relating to religion and the state. The vagueness of certain of its provisions would allow lawyers and politicians to interpret it however they see fit. Against the background of these statements, the article pursues two objectives: First, it demonstrates that the constitution provides an institutional setting which prevents arbitrary readings of the constitutional text by lawyers and politicians. Second, it argues that the text can and actually shall be interpreted in a reconcilable manner without significant legal contradictions.

Ideological Roots of the Ḥūthī Movement in Yemen,2016,"This paper deals with the Ḥūthī insurgency in Yemen. It focuses on the movement by asking and attempting to answer the following questions: is the Ḥūthī insurgency sectarian-based? and is it part of the overall competition between Sunnīs and Shīʿa in the Middle East? To answer these questions, the paper analyzes lectures given by its founder, Hussein Badr al-Dīn al-Ḥūthī. By paying close attention to the ideological framework of al-Ḥūthī, this paper concludes that sectarianism is part of the Yemeni conflict and the emergence of the Ḥūthīs. At the same time, the analysis reveals that Hussein Badr al-Dīn al-Ḥūthī was preoccupied by the poor position of Muslims and believed that their situation could be improved through uprising, especially if it was under the banner of Shīʿism in general and Zaydiyya in particular.

"Democracy, women’s rights, and public opinion in Tunisia",2016,"The Arab Spring demonstrated that public opinion can powerfully affect the region’s political life. Tunisia is particularly important in this regard; it is the Arab country where democracy has taken firmest root and is therefore of enormous geopolitical significance insofar as it can serve as a model for other countries in the region. This article assesses the state of Tunisian democracy using data from a 2015 survey of 1580 Tunisian adults. It finds that most of the country’s citizens are ambivalent or skeptical about the Arab Spring’s benefits, while support for freedom of speech has weakened in recent years. A multivariate analysis assesses the impact of socio-demographic factors and support for women’s rights (key to the entrenchment of democracy in Tunisia) on democratic attitudes. It is concluded that, while Tunisia’s political record to date provides grounds for cautiously forecasting that democracy will endure, its path is unlikely to be easy.

Out of Syria: Mobile Media in Use at the Time of Civil War,2016,"ABSTRACT: Social media usage during the recent uprisings in Arab countries has gained increasing attention in human–computer interaction research. This study adds to these insights by providing some findings on the use of information and communications technology (ICT), specifically mobile media, by opposition forces and political activists during the Syrian civil war. The presented study is based on 17 interviews with Syrian FSA fighters, activists, and refugees. A first analysis showed evidence for some very specific use patterns during wartime (compared to media usage of political activists under less anomic conditions). The study also describes a fragmented telecom infrastructure in Syria: government-controlled regions offer fairly intact infrastructures while rebel-controlled regions have been cut off from telephone and Internet. Moreover, the central and very critical role of mobile video for documenting, mobilization, and propaganda is discussed.

Transforming tunisia: Transitional justice and internet governance in a post-revolutionary society,2016,"In this article we argue that examining efforts at Internet reform in Tunisia holds important lessons for transitional justice (TJ) theory and practice, as well as for the way the field defines itself in a space where technology plays an important role in facilitating both repression and transitions. Given the impact of the Tunisian revolution in inspiring the Arab uprisings, as well as those elsewhere, an examination of the Tunisian revolution offers many lessons in understanding the transition away from authoritarian government. We focus specifically on what the Tunisian process of Internet reform can tell us about the increasingly institutionalized implementation of the TJ framework. This process is particularly notable because it has been informed by TJ goals and discourse while remaining outside the formal mechanisms implemented in the wake of the revolution. We examine the more flexible and responsive ways in which local institutions and activists might approach transition, including through attempts to memorialize the impacts of a regime or conflict, build trust, incorporate diverse voices in new partnerships and manage the international dimensions of postconflict reconstruction. Finally, given the Internet's central role as both a tool for repression and a site of resistance and democratic engagement, our findings indicate the importance of future work in considering how TJ can begin addressing Internet governance as a vital aspect of conflict resolution and rebuilding.

"Refugees of the Syrian Civil War: Impact on Reemerging Infections, Health Services, and Biosecurity in Turkey",2016,"After the Arab Spring uprising, Syria descended into a civil war in 2011. By March 2016, the United Nations reported that 13.5 million Syrians required humanitarian assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced persons and more than 4.8 million refugees outside of Syria. Turkey is currently hosting the largest number of Syrian refugees - more than 2.7 million. A limited number of refugees are living in camps settled around the border, and others are spread throughout Turkey. This explosive and unexpected increase in the Syrian population in Turkey has had several negative impacts on health and social determinants. The overload of healthcare facilities has led to shortages in childhood immunization programs, drugs, and access to clean water and food supplies. According to Ministry of Health data, more than 7.5 million Syrians were examined at outpatient clinics, and 299,240 were hospitalized; most of those hospitalized were injured and wounded victims who require and have been occupying intensive care units. The refugees generally live in crowded and unsanitary conditions, which may lead to the spread of respiratory, skin, gastrointestinal, and genital system infections. Currently, measles, poliomyelitis, leishmaniasis, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are the reemerging infections being most frequently recorded.

A Theory of Critical Junctures for Democratization: A Comparative Examination of Constitution-Making in Egypt and Tunisia,2016,"Most studies on constitution-making emphasize how cultural and institutional characteristics independently impact successful democratic transitions. This article proposes a new approach to theorizing this process, positing that the character of institutional and cultural elements and the relationships between them give rise to a unique temporal and political context called a critical juncture, with qualities and characteristics that place some states on trajectories toward success and others toward failure. By analyzing and comparing the events surrounding the Egyptian and Tunisian transitions, we demonstrate how the placement of these institutional and cultural elements put Tunisia on the path to democratization and led Egypt inevitably toward autocracy. The findings show that, where these junctures fail to instill civic ideals and avenues for all parties' participation, the political environment becomes uninhabitable for successful transition.

This argument assumes that there was more agreement on R2P before the Libyan intervention than there was afterwards.

Transitional Justice as Elite Justice? Compromise Justice and Transition in Tunisia,2016,"This article reflects upon the ways in which transitional justice debates and processes impacted Tunisia's transition. It explores key questions such as what demands for justice emerged in the aftermath of the Tunisian revolution? Did Tunisia's transitional justice process reflect these demands? And, did international norms of transitional justice, which emerged from a field of practice that draws heavily upon European, Latin America and Sub-Saharan experiences, but has largely excluded the Arab Middle East, serve to mediate between competing demands for justice in the aftermath of the Tunisian revolution? It will be argued that transitional justice demands in Tunisia reflected a breakdown in the state-society socioeconomic bargain, which had maintained autocratic regimes since independence in 1956; however, due to the elite-centred nature of transitional justice discourses, many transitional justice demands never resonated into mainstream transitional justice discourse. We will argue that international transitional justice entrepreneurs' attempt to import a normative framework that was ill suited to grapple with the complex legacies of socioeconomic marginalization, resulted in a growing disillusionment and disengagement from the state driven transitional justice process on the part of Tunisian society.

Constitutionalism and political order in Libya 2011–2014: three myths about the past and a new constitution,2016,"Libya’s 2011 revolution enabled ordinary citizens and an emerging civil society to voice their demands on a variety of key issues including Libya’s new constitution. Libyans faced the challenge of redefining and re-empowering national political institutions through the establishment of a new constitution. This article analyses a series of constitutional grassroots debates that were led by the Forum for Democratic Libya (FDL), thereby unpacking insights not only into the constitutional process itself but also into the underlying expectations regarding a new political order in the country. We argue that the brief period of relative peace and stability in Libya between 2011 and 2013 presents a ‘golden age’ of constitutional activities that created meaningful interface among Libyan citizens after decades of oppression. We argue however that although constitutional debates allowed for citizen engagement in the process of constitutional development it had little bearing on the outcomes of this process. Citizen demands remained unanswered due to deeply entrenched informal political practices causing activists to face the arduous task of trying to influence a formal process of constitutional development. Priority demands expressed by citizens in our research pointed to the need for Libyan political actors to address the creation of a new system of governance, civil liberties and three regional priorities namely immigration and citizenship in Southern Libya, reconciliation and justice in Western Libya, and natural resources in Eastern Libya. The priorities remain unaddressed in Libya and provide insights of priority issues that will require serious efforts in the future of a stable Libya.

Foreign Terrorist Fighters: managing a twenty-first century threat,2016,"In the aftermath of the Arab uprisings Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) have emerged as a significant security challenge. Since the 1980s and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan the notion of a ‘foreign fighter’ has been closely linked, if not synonymous, with those ideologically or religiously motivated individuals who have travelled to join conflicts in Islamic lands. This article will explore the contemporary FTF movement, offering a comparison of Afghanistan in the 1980s and Syria in the contemporary period. It will explore the international community’s expansive responses to the challenge of FTFs, with special focus on the role of the United Nations.

Street Scenes: The Politics of Revolutionary Video in Egypt,2016,"Images of mass protests that arose from Egypt in early 2011 enraptured global audiences with unexpected scenes of street politics and unprecedented possibilities for political change. While the presence of thousands of cellphone cameras, perhaps hundreds of thousands, provided the technology for a multitude of witnessing, the hyper-visibility of the street in times of protest made image-making practices both threatening and powerful. The recursive rehabilitation of counter-revolutionary images happened on many fronts. Western journalists have long characterized the “Arab Street” as a “barbarous urban mob” and, despite enchantment with the “Arab Spring,” still perpetuated a simplistic analysis of street politics in the region. Meanwhile local television, advertising, and music videos endlessly recycled revolutionary images in superficial modes of patriotic sentimentality; while the urban poor, unable to realize the aims of “bread, freedom, and social justice,” have suspiciously remained the unclaimed image of the Egyptian revolution. But by attending to the social life of revolutionary street media, this article reviews the potential for emerging image practice to cultivate new kinds of political subjectivity and collectivity.

The structure-identity nexus: Syria and Turkey’s collapse (2011),2016,"The relation between Syria and Turkey transformed from enmity in the 1990s to détente in the early 2000s, grew into amity after the rise to power of the Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP, Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi) in 2002, and reverted to enmity in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. This research suggests that a combination of structural and identity-based factors, at regional and domestic levels, induced the collapse of the decade-long amity. This paper builds on the notion of a “structure-identity nexus”; and determines the orientation of foreign policy outcomes from the 1990s until 2011. The discussion outlines the merits of a hybrid theoretical perspective by elaborating on Barkin’s idea of ‘realist constructivism’, which draws on two rival traditions, realism and constructivism. The structure-identity framework explains the double transformation in the relationship, considering the return to inter- and intra-state conflict in 2011. The research draws on extensive primary and secondary sources, as well as interviews carried out with key figures. In addition to the relationship between Syria and Turkey, the structure-identity nexus provides potential broader explanations that fuel the shift from amity to enmity in the complex network of states found in the Middle East.

From the February 17 Revolution to Benghazi: rewriting history for political gain,2016,"ABSTRACT: In February 2011, peaceful demonstrations in Benghazi and other Libyan cities in support of additional housing, more jobs, and a better way life quickly turned into demands for regime change after security forces employed deadly force in an effort to subdue the protesters. As the February 17 Revolution unfolded, the better equipped and trained security forces of the Qaddafi regime soon bested inexperienced and poorly armed rebel units, threatening to retake Benghazi and engage in acts of retribution similar to those the regime had employed in the past to punish acts of dissent or revolt. In response, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973, authorising member states to take ‘all necessary measures’ to protect civilians under threat of attack. The policies of the Qaddafi regime in the years before the February 17 Revolution and in the early weeks of the revolt thoroughly justified the UN-supported military intervention that began in mid-March 2011; nevertheless, some academics, journalists, and politicians have distorted events in this time frame to argue that it was not a model intervention but a model failure. Kindred spirits have seized on a contrived, misleading analysis to challenge the foreign policy legacy of the Obama administration and the role in Libya of then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Historical revisionism enjoys a long and cherished tradition; however, a selective rendering of events for political gain undermines the democratic process in both Libya and the USA and threatens to distort future policy decisions on Libya and other countries, replacing authoritarian regimes with democracies.

Crude oil prices and sectoral stock returns in Jordan around the Arab uprisings of 2010,2016,"In this paper, we test for mean and variance causality between world oil prices and sectoral equity returns in Jordan before and after the Arab Uprisings that started in 2010. The testing methodology is based on the sample of cross-correlation functions that are computed from the standardized residuals of a GARCH process. Our results show that the influence is not uniform across the equity sectors. The oil return shocks significantly impact the Financials and the Services sectors, while its effect is insignificant on the Industrials sector. This result is more pronounced in the period that follows the Arab Uprisings. In terms of risk transfer, we find that oil is a negligible risk factor. However, there is still a significant evidence of risk transmission to the Industrials sector particularly during the Arab Uprisings period. These results represent a unique information transmission mechanism that is useful for risk management and portfolio diversification.

To this aim, the bottom-up and top-down dimensions of EU‒Morocco relations are analysed diachronically both before and after the Arab Spring. The analysis shows that the Moroccan ruling elite has used the anchor to the EU as a survival strategy and that the EU has merely responded to Moroccan political liberalization rather than having influenced it. Therefore, the paper debates the extent to which the very notion of Europeanization might be used with respect to democratization policies in Morocco, and it shows an overturning of the sender‒receiver relationship proving that Europeanization has been used instrumentally rather than having any autonomous supportive effect on democratization.

Sunnis are likely to view Turkey and Saudi Arabia positively in both regards, whereas Shiites are more supportive of Iran. But our results also suggest that crosscutting cleavages should not be overlooked: Sunni Kurds are less likely to hold positive attitudes toward Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Our findings also show that Copts, a religious minority in Egypt, hold positive attitudes toward the United States and negative ones toward Saudi Arabia and Iran.

An increase in gender-based violence and early marriage, a lack of access to emergency obstetric care, limited access to contraception, forced cesarean sections, and high cost of healthcare services, all contribute to poor sexual and reproductive health.

The first phases of elimination arose from a combination of diplomacy, economic sanctions, and fears by the Libyan government of possible military action. This phase effectively reversed Muammar Qaddafi’s attempt to develop a nuclear program and prevented the Libyan government from having access to chemical weapons when the “Arab Spring” reached Libya. The ensuing civil war brought new challenges to elimination: a breakdown in security, increased risk of chemicalweapons proliferation to violent extremists, and the discovery of a previously unknown stockpile of filled chemical munitions. Following Qaddafi’s death, the second phase restarted the chemical-weapons elimination and presented new challenges still. These included the need for rapid action to complete the destruction, negotiating with an interim government, and assisting destruction without US personnel on the ground in Libya.

The ‘Rojava revolution’ in Syrian Kurdistan: A model of development for the middle east?,2016,"As the civil war in Syria continues, in the territory of Rojava - in Kurdish, ‘the West’ - the northern Syrian Kurdish political movement is attempting to implement ‘libertarian municipalism’, based on the thoughts of United States (US) anarchist Murray Bookchin. Since the withdrawal of Syrian regime forces in 2012, the movement has consolidated significant territorial gains as a US ally in the anti-Islamic State (IS) struggle, while simultaneously securing Russian support. Viewed with suspicion by Turkey, Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, the geopolitical conditions of Rojava’s emergence are its greatest impediment. This article analyses Rojava’s model of rule and socioeconomic development, and its theory and practice in the context of the civil war, and regional Middle Eastern and wider global geopolitics. It reflects on Rojava’s place and meaning for contemporary geopolitics in the Middle East, and considers the territory’s prospects, discussing its transformative potential for an otherwise troubled region.

Discovery of a Devonian mafic magmatism on the western border of the Murzuq basin (Saharan metacraton): Paleomagnetic dating and geodynamical implications,2016,"Intraplate deformation is most often linked to major stress applied on plate margins. When such intraplate events are accompanied by magmatism, the use of several dating methods integrated within a multidisciplinary approach can bring constraints on the age, nature and source mobilized for generating the magma and in turn on the nature of the intraplate deformation. This study focuses on the large gabbro Arrikine sill (35 km in extension) emplaced within the Silurian sediments of the western margin of the Murzuq cratonic basin in southeastern Algeria. Its emplacement is dated during the early Devonian (415-400 Ma) through the determination of a reliable paleomagnetic pole by comparison with the Gondwana Apparent Polar Wander Path (APWP). This age can be correlated with deep phreatic eruptions before Pragian time thought to be at the origin of sand injections and associated circular structures in Algeria and Libya. For the sill, the K-Ar age of 325.6 ± 7.7 Ma is related to a K-rich aplitic phase that has K-enriched by more than 20% the Devonian gabbro. Laser-ICP-MS U-Pb method dates only inherited zircons mostly at c. 2030 Ma with additional ages at c. 2700 Ma and younger ones in the 766-598 Ma age range. The Arrikine sill is a high-Ti alkaline gabbro having the geochemical composition of a hawaiite akin to several intraplate continental and oceanic provinces, including the contemporaneous Aïr ring complexes province in Niger, but also to the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. This peculiar composition akin to that of the contemporaneous Aïr province is in agreement with a lower Devonian age for the Arrikine sill.The lower Devonian Arrikine sill emplacement is related to a ""Caledonian"" transtensive reactivation of the western metacratonic boundary of the Murzuq craton. This event also generated in the Saharan platform the so-called ""Caledonian unconformity"" of regional extension, the Aïr ring complexes and magmatic rocks that produced sand injections. It could be related to rifting of the Hun terranes that occurred at the plate margin to the north (Stampfli and Borel, 2002, Blackey, 2008 and references therein). The mid-Carboniferous (c. 326 Ma) reactivation corresponds to Variscan compression on NW Africa generating aplitic fluids, but also to the major ""Hercynian unconformity"" of regional extension. The generation of the Arrikine magma is attributed to partial melting through adiabatic pressure release of uprising asthenosphere along tectonically reactivated mega-shear zones, here bordering the relictual Murzuq craton enclosed in the Saharan metacraton.

Tax policy challenges in an era of political transition: The case of Egypt,2016,"Tax policy is normally formulated and implemented during politically stable periods. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries in the early 1990s have allowed researchers to study tax policy reform in transition economies with changing political and economic systems. This article aims to examine tax policy challenges in Egypt as a result of the revolution in 2011. Egypt has been chosen because of its importance in the Arab world and its interesting tax reform, including a rationalisation of tax incentives. It is found that Egypt has adopted a combination of counter-cyclical government expenditure policy and pro-cyclical tax policy in an era of political transition. This combination is interesting as it is well known that developed countries tend to employ counter-cyclical fiscal policy whereas developing countries tend to utilise pro-cyclical policy. It is proposed that the Egyptian government should consider modernising its tax administration and enhancing its anti-tax avoidance activities as an alternative to increasing tax rates in pursuing its pro-cyclical tax policy.","Tax policy challenges in an era of political transition: The case of Egypt Tax policy is normally formulated and implemented during politically stable periods.

On the contrary to accounts that claim that the taming of ideological conflicts between religious and secular parties has given birth to a new democratic society, I argue that the new Tunisian order is the result of a particular type of post-authoritarian political culture that I call bargained competition. It consists in Islamists and old regime elites bargaining on their mutual reintegration and their monopolization of the post-revolutionary political scene while fiercely competing over political resources through various (often informal) power-sharing arrangements.

Internet censorship circumvention tools: Escaping the control of the syrian regime,2016,"Studies have shown that authoritarian regimes tend to censor the media to limit potential threats to the status quo. While such censorship practices were traditionally aimed at broadcast and print media, the emergence of the Internet and social media in particular, prompted some authoritarian regimes, such as the Assad regime in Syria, to try and exert a similar lev-el of censorship on the Internet as well. During the Arab Spring, the Syrian regime blocked hundreds of websites that provided social networking, news, and other services. Taking Syria as a case study, this paper examines whether Internet censorship succeeded in preventing Internet users from reaching censored online content during 2010−2012. By analyzing the use of Alkasir, a censorship circumvention tool created by the author, the paper provides empirical evidence demonstrating that users were in fact able to bypass censorship and access blocked websites. The findings demonstrate that censor-ship circumvention tools constituted a threat to the information control systems of authoritarian regimes, highlighting the potential of such tools to promote online freedom of expression in countries where Internet censorship is prevalent.

Through this comparative analysis, the article evaluates the impact of these two channels’ political contexts on their coverage, especially considering that these two channels are part of broader transnational news networks that are based in countries that were active participants in the NATO intervention in Libya. The sample involves a period of roughly four weeks of coverage, and considers aspects such as the birth of the February 17 movement in Libya, the development of the opposition, the beginning and end of the 2011 NATO mission and the death of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The sample was analysed by means of a framing analysis, whereby framing refers to the way a news story is packaged, and is an especially appropriate method when considering the influence of political power on coverage. The comparative analysis ultimately found that both channels’ coverage was primarily affected by their political contexts, and aligned with national and foreign policy interests of their home countries. This alignment was evident through the coverage that was supportive of the opposition and its advances, and the intervention and its gains. However, BBC Arabic’s coverage was more balanced, especially with regard to the progression of the opposition on the ground, as it did not play up opposition gains or gloss over opposition losses, as Al Jazeera Arabic tended to do. BBC Arabic also displayed a more analytical stance when covering the death of the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The language used by Al Jazeera Arabic was also far more emotive and sensationalistic than that of BBC Arabic, which displayed a far more tempered stance when covering the Libyan uprising. Thus, this article also considers how each of these channels used the Arabic language when reporting, and how these stylistic differences might have affected their coverage.

The price of influence: ethics and British foreign policy in the Arab Middle East after Iraq,2016,"This article examines British approaches to ethics in foreign policy in the post-Blair era through a comparative analysis between London's responses to the ‘Arab uprisings’, namely the recent upheavals in Libya and Syria, and the Blair government's invasion of Iraq in 2003. It puts forward fresh perspectives on the role of diaspora groups with progressivist political agendas in challenging prevailing official discourses of British foreign policy. The article argues that the ethics of Britain's strategy in the region continue to be defined by moral inconsistency and incoherence as well as by a problematic relationship to the ‘foreign’ itself.

"Dynamics of transformation, elite change and new social mobilization in the Arab World",2016,"Abstract: This article provides a conceptual framework for a special issue of Mediterranean Politics that investigates the transformation processes inaugurated in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen in 2011 in the wake of the uprisings commonly referred to as the “Arab Spring”. It proposes that these processes should not be conceptualized as linear and centrally crafted transitions from authoritarian orders towards preconceived outcomes, but rather, as contested and open-ended transformations. These are best understood through an actor-centered approach that focuses on the choices and strategies of the ‘Politically Relevant Elite’ (PRE) and its interactions with citizens intent on exerting influence, described here as ‘Mobilized Publics’. Drawing on the results of eight research papers presented in this volume, this article argues that the PRE perceived the transformation processes as mechanisms to maximize political resources and monopolize power. The ensuing, increasingly polarized contestations hastened the cooptation and instrumentalization of mobilized publics by the PRE, thus spelling the end of their capacity to offer avenues for broad, bottom-up participation and preparing the ground for renewed top-down control in Egypt and Tunisia, and to state failure and civil war in Libya and Yemen.

NGO Policy in Pre-and Post-Mubarak Egypt: Effects on NGOs' Roles in Democracy Promotion,2016,"This article examines the Egyptian government's evolving policy toward Egypt's NGO sector and its effects on organizations' efforts to support democratic political reform. The January 25, 2011 uprisings that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak seemed to present an opportunity for Egypt's NGO sector to break free from decades of government co-optation and repression and lead Egyptian civil society's political reform efforts. NGOs did initiate democracy promotion projects immediately following the uprisings, and for a few months it seemed that NGOs would be torchbearers of political reform. By the summer of 2014, however, NGO employees were predicting the looming ""death of civil society""in Egypt.

Understanding Politically Motivated Sexual Assault in Protest Spaces: Evidence from Egypt (March 2011 to June 2013),2016,"Women have been at the forefront of protest movements in Arab revolts, and whilst their activism has been the subject of a growing body of scholarly work, there is a paucity of literature on their exposure to sexual assault during demonstrations. This article is an empirical study of the increasing politicization of sexual assault in Egypt’s transition between March 2011 and June 2013, which seeks to contribute to the broader literature on sexual violence in contexts that are politically tumultuous and polarized but are not technically ‘at war’. It draws on the literature on rape as a weapon of war without isolating sexual aggression in protest spaces from the continuum of gender-based violence that is socially, politically and legally embedded in the context of Egypt. The article argues that a number of factors if analysed individually suggest there is no difference in the dynamics of sexual violence in protest and non-protest spaces, however, when taken as a constellation of factors, they suggest a pattern that is politically driven, in particular, when their commissioning and targeting are commensurate with the political deployment of sexual violence identified in the rape as a weapon of war literature.

Nubians in Contemporary Egypt: Mobilizing Return to Ancestral Lands,2016,"ABSTRACT: Based on original fieldwork, this article examines how Nubians in Egypt have mobilized to demand a return to ancestral lands along the Nile River. It begins with a historically informed analysis explaining how any attempts to make demands from the Egyptian state long have been quashed, effectively constraining any comprehensive mobilization. It thereafter argues that the emergence of several unprecedented legal and political opportunities in the past decade paved the way for substantial Nubian mobilization. This culminated in a Nubian representation in the drafting process of the 2014 Egyptian Constitution, and a subsequent constitutional reference to Nubian return. Finally, this article explores how Nubian activists have deployed competing legal and historical frames in demanding return to ancestral lands. These frames range from the right of return based on international indigenous/minority rights frameworks, to drawing parallels with the Palestinian right of return, to a less confrontational development discourse rooted in the displacement of the Nubians in the 1960s.

Ibn al-balad vs. Ibn al-zawat in the land of the two pharaohs,2016,"An analysis of Egypt’s January 2011 uprising reveals a strong class, and classist, dimension: a deep and pervasive antagonism between the upper and lower classes, between the classes that are westernized elites and those that are from the popular sectors of the population. These two segments are identified as ibn al-balad “sons of the country” and ibn al-zawat “people of importance” (“awlad” is the plural of “ibn”). The essay contends that the Islamist elements in the political arena, Muslim Brothers, Salafis, and liberal Islamists, represent the lower classes whereas the secular liberal parties are a reflection of elite interests. The essay focuses on the “sons of the country.” After describing the government’s massacre of Islamists in August 2013, it traces how government policy in the 1960s forced large numbers of villagers to migrate from the countryside and replenish the ranks of the urban working classes. The policies discussed here are (1) the government’s extensive agricultural price controls that engineered poverty, and (2) the regulation of the construction sector and its countless small informal sector firms that employ these migrants. The paternalism that permeates the agricultural and construction sectors is the same paternalism that binds working-class supporters (awlad al-balad) to middle-class professionals in the latter’s campaign to mount an Islamist program of radical political reform. The government attacked the Islamists and their populist program in 1992 in the “Battle of Imbaba” and again in the massacre at Rab'a al-Adawiya mosque in August 2013. It was this reform program that catapulted Muhammad Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party into office through two elections, and it was this reform program that antagonized the awlad al-zawat into deposing Mursi through a military coup d’état. The Islamists were declared illegal under Husni Mubarak, the first of the two pharaohs, and have been declared illegal once again under ‘Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi, the current pharaoh in power.

The Arab uprisings and the united states: The dichotomy between balancing stability and upholding commitment to democracy,2016,"The Arab Spring, a revolutionary movement for democracy that swept across the Arab Middle East in 2010, has contributed to the downfall of several oppressive authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. The movement represented several uprisings that placed the United States in a precarious position.

This article argues that the American administration under President Barak Obama squandered this opportunity by pursuing an incoherent and inconsistent policy. This policy revealed Obama’s support of the uprisings calls for political reforms that aligned with American liberal values. However, the policy also reflected a commitment to ensure security and stability by maintaining autocratic regimes the protesters hoped to overthrow.

"Folk poetry, local knowledge, and resistance in Tunisia",2016,"In pre-Islamic times, Arabic poetry was a potent propaganda weapon among the nomadic Arabian tribes. More than 15 centuries later, not much has changed. In the twenty-first century, Arabic poetry is still used ritualistically to celebrate harvests, weddings, and other happy events, but also to put up a defensive shield against encroachments by outsiders, or to lament the loss of a loved one, the devastation by natural disasters, or the generation gap and loss of a traditional Bedouin lifestyle. The verbal prowess of Arabic nomadic groups led to a flourishing of poetry in both fuṣḥā/classical and dārija/dialectical Arabic. This essay looks at Tunisian folk poetry – what might be called ‘literature from below’ – as a potent force sustaining political resistance and cultural identity. We focus on two features of folk poetry (malḥūn in dārija) in southern Tunisia: poetry as resistance to authoritarian regimes, both before and after the January 14, 2011 revolution; and poetry as resistance to the consumerist onslaught, be it Beldi (urban) or neo-liberal, on traditional Bedouin lifestyles.

Working on the Revolution in Bahrain: From the Mass Strike to Everyday Forms of Medical Provision,2016,"The 2011 Arab Spring uprising with the highest levels of popular support took place in Bahrain. This level of mobilization was due in part to the organizational capacity of trade unions and professional associations, and yet their role in the ‘near-revolution’ has received very little scholarly attention. In contrast to Egypt and Tunisia, where the official trade union federations played an ambiguous or even hostile role as workers began to organize strikes during the protests against Ben Ali and Mubarak, the official General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions not only supported the protests against the Al Khalifa regime, but called for two general strikes. As significant as the strikes were, the work of unpaid volunteers constituted another less recognized, but equally important form of labor activism. Understanding the mass mobilization in Bahrain, and elsewhere, requires an encompassing approach to labor: one that can conceptualize equally the ability of collectivities to stop working, but also the ability to collectively continue to work, even on an unpaid basis. I will illustrate the contradictory role of the labor movement with examples from the Bahrain Teachers’ Association and the Bahrain Nursing Society. The majority of members of both associations were women. Finally, the Bahraini regime punished both forms of labor activism – both the teachers who went on strike, and the nurses who declared they would not strike but continue to work and care for the injured protesters.

The Court found that the applicants had been unlawfully detained in Italy and that they were not provided information or the possibility to challenge their detention. Moreover, the conditions of detention amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. Finally, according to the Court, the applicants had been subject to collective expulsion, as despite their individual identification by Italian authorities, the personal circumstances of each of them had not been evaluated prior to their removal to Tunisia.

The Court found that the applicants had been unlawfully detained in Italy and that they were not provided information or the possibility to challenge their detention. Moreover, the conditions of detention amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. Finally, according to the Court, the applicants had been subject to collective expulsion, as despite their individual identification by Italian authorities, the personal circumstances of each of them had not been evaluated prior to their removal to Tunisia. This note considers the Italian immigration policy in the light of the European Convention of Human Rights and of the examined decision, mainly in relation to the controversial aspects of the detention and expulsion of migrants.

Social media and social change,2016,"The growing impact of new media around the world has been the subject of study by scores of scientists in multidisciplinary fields. Satellite TV and the Internet have been viewed as instruments of social and political change — connecting communities, educating the youth, and creating social networks previously unaccounted for, like virtual groups. However, in the Arab World and the Middle East, such technological developments have been hailed as tools for the empowerment of marginalized communities such as women and the youth, also brought new opportunities that have resulted in the breaking of the communication monopoly by those in power and the creation of a new communication environment. Such environment has — as part of its manifestations — the current social transformations that the region is witnessing. Drawing on examples from social media networks used in Tunisia and Egypt, this article analyzes the extent to which new technologies have changed the rules of the game regarding public opinion construction and the communication flow traditionally monopolized by the hegemonic power structures in Arab society. This study not only reveals the decisiveness of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in the Arab Spring countries’ revolutions, but also the extent to which their availability served in a complex manner the democratic transition that Tunisia have been undergoing and the political turmoil that Egypt is witnessing. Furthermore this study argues that such online spheres of communication mark the emergence of the virtual yet vibrant space of political campaigning and social empowerment, especially for the youth and marginalized communities.

Saudi regime resilience after the 2011 Arab popular uprisings,2016,"Although all Arab monarchies (Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Jordan and Morocco) witnessed varying degrees of mass protest during the Arab uprisings of 2011, none of the kings and princes has thus far been deposed. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia saw pockets of sporadic protest in many cities in the early months of 2011, but those failed to evolve into a mass protest movement across the country.

A panoramic perspective on Islamist movements in the Middle East,2016,"This article discusses and analyses the landscape of Islamist movements in Egypt using a network approach, and showing where connections lie between different movements across North Africa. The article unpacks the centripetal forces that bring Islamist movements together in ‘uber-ideology coalitions’ and the moments where centrifugal forces serve to divide and splinter movements. The article challenges the mainstream narrative on Islamist movements and violence in two critical ways. First, contrary to analysts’ forecasts of a ‘post-Islamist age’, one of the ripple effects of the Arab Spring was the revival and proliferation of Islamist movements on a grand scale. Second, the article challenges the discourse that attributes the rise in radical militancy almost exclusively to the obfuscation of democratic politics through the emergence of counterrevolutionary forces. Rather, it argues that the Arab revolts created the political and security environment that allowed radical Islamist movements to flex their muscles.

The impact of Jordanian anti-money laundering laws on banks,2016,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the Jordanian anti-money laundering law and its instructions on the Jordanian banking industry. The anti-money laundering law in Jordan is newly enacted, but there are new developments not covered by the law. For instance, the revolutionary wave known as the Arab Spring surrounding Jordan has increased the crime rates in Jordan, and it has also reduced international coordination and cooperation to encounter money laundering operations. The emergence of new means for money transfer is affecting the efficiency and speed of bank transfers. Subsequently, the impact of the law on Jordanian banks is unknown. Design/methodology/approach – This paper relies on the Jordanian Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Law 2007 as a primary source of information. The relevant Jordanian anti-money laundering instructions that have directly been affecting banks include the Jordanian Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Instructions Number (51) 2010. These instructions were considered the most important legislation for the purpose of this paper. Findings – While the Jordanian anti-money laundering law is based on certain principles, the effectiveness of the law is unknown. The Arab Spring, particularly the Syrian revolution, has negatively increased the crime rates and money laundering activities in Jordan. To make matters worse, the international cooperation and coordination between countries in combating money laundering are not at the required level, and this has encouraged money laundering groups to exploit the situation. Only time will tell whether the banks will be able to cope sufficiently with the increased anti-money laundering obligations. Obviously, it is critical at this stage to establish effective coordination between legislators, regulators and the banking industry to minimize problems encountered by the banks, thereby to ensure effective implementation of the law. Originality/value – This paper provides an examination of the impact of the Jordanian anti-money laundering law that has directly affected banks. It is hoped that this paper would provide some insight into this particular area for academics, practitioners, the legal advisers, banks and policy-makers not only in Jordan but also elsewhere. In view of the international nature of money laundering and banking, there will be significant interest in how the anti-money laundering law affects banks operation in Jordan.

The identity process in times of rupture: Narratives from the Egyptian revolution,2016,"This is a longitudinal study of the identity process through times of dramatic social change. Using a narrative psychological approach this research follows the life stories of five Egyptian bloggers as they write their stories on online blogs over the course of the three years following the 2011 revolution, at which time Egypt has witnessed major social and political changes. The aim is to understand the identity process of individuals as they develop and adapt through changing social contexts and how they create alternative social relations as they engage in prefigurative politics. The findings shed light on how ruptures trigger a process of reflexivity, adaptive learning, and sense-making that facilitates coping and the reconstruction of a positive identity after ruptures. It also suggests that the narration of the experience of rupture through storytelling creates a heightened sense of agency in individuals’ ability to create new meanings of their world in spite of the socio-cultural and political constraints. This study presents narratives as an informing methodological resource that connects identity process with social representations and emphasizes the value of storytelling as an integral part of the adaptation process.

Conquest of Paradise: Secular Binds and Coptic Political Mobilization,2016,"Abstract: This article explores conflicts within the Coptic community related to problems of definition and representation. Coptic groups that emerged from Egypt’s 2011 revolution brought these tensions to the fore. Groups such as the prominent Maspero Youth Union (MYU) [Itihad Shabab Maspero] were formed to contest the hegemony of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egyptian national politics. The MYU and others have attempted to reconstruct social boundaries drawn by the Church and the state, promoting political secularism, or the separation of religion from politics, as a solution to inter-communal strife and remedy to intra-communal conflict over the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church as the sole representative of the community. At the same time, the group has emphasized their Coptic identity through religious symbols and imagery at protest events, as depicted at the Maspero memorial march in 2012. While the MYU officially endorsed secular governance as a means to overcome sectarianism, its actions also made visible internal conflicts over the representation of Coptic identity in contemporary Egyptian society. Although the promise of secularism and equal citizenship is not specific to the Coptic or Egyptian context, this article focuses on its paradoxical effects within the Coptic community and its relationship to the state.

The Arab spring: A fourth wave of democratization?,2016,"Between 1974 and 1990, over 30 countries in southern Europe, Latin America, some parts of Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa made transitions to democracy, nearly doubling the number of democratic governments in the world. Samuel Huntington described this global shift as “Democracy’s Third Wave” in an article published in 1991, which was later developed in a book titled The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century. In these two works, he discusses the causes, features, and transition processes of the third wave of democracy and examines its prospects for sustainability and possible expansion in a nondemocratic world. He argues that the first and second democratic waves “were followed not merely by some backsliding but major reverse waves during which most regime changes throughout the world were from democracy to authoritarianism” (Huntington, 1991a). He also addresses the causative factors of this reverse wave in some countries, and he claims that the third wave of democratization that swept the world in the 1970s and 1980s might become a dominant feature of Middle Eastern and North African politics in the 1990s. The delay in this prophecy for two decades motivates us to question whether the Arab Spring is part of Huntington’s third wave of democratization or a new fourth wave of democratization, or even a false start to democracy, as described by Larry Diamond (2011). The purpose of this article is to examine the causes, features, and transition processes of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen in correlation with Huntington’s theorization on the third wave of democratization which, along with other available literature in the field, will be combined in a theoretical framework that will enable us to discuss the abovementioned elements of the Arab Spring through the lens of the third wave of democratization. Special attention is paid to the question of whether the Arab Spring falls into the framework of Huntington’s theory, or whether it can be classified as a new fourth wave of democratization in countries that have unfavorable environments for democracy.

However, it was Egyptian citizens’ perception of the political dynamics behind the economic situation that drove them to revolt. In 2011, a sense of intolerable levels of corruption and the prospect of their continuation under Mubarak’s son, Gamal, made people responsive to calls for revolution; in 2013, it was the scale of their disappointment at the unmet promises for economic betterment. In both cases, economic conditions were crucial, but political grievances and mobilisation ultimately determined and shaped the revolts.

"Exit, resistance, loyalty: Military behavior during unrest in authoritarian regimes",2016,"A few years into the most recent wave of popular uprisings - the Arab Spring - studying regime trajectories in countries such as Syria, Egypt, and Yemen still seems like shooting at a moving target. Yet what has not escaped notice is the central role military actors have played during these uprisings. We describe how soldiers have three options when ordered to suppress mass unrest. They may exit the regime by remaining in the barracks or going into exile, resist by fighting for the challenger or initiating a coup d'état, or remain loyal and use force to defend the regime. We argue that existing accounts of civil-military relations are ill equipped to explain the diverse patterns in exit, resistance, and loyalty during unrest because they often ignore the effects of military hierarchy. Disaggregating the military and parsing the interests and constraints of different agents in that apparatus is crucial for explaining military cohesion during such crises. Drawing on extensive fieldwork we apply our principal-agent framework to explain varying degrees and types of military cohesion in three Arab Spring cases: Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria. Studying military hierarchy elucidates decision-making within authoritarian regimes amid mass mobilization and allows us to better explain regime re-stabilization, civil war onset, or swift regime change in the wake of domestic unrest.

Rethinking the youth bulge and violence,2016,"The dominance of a generation of combat age, high levels of education combined with high unemployment, failed cities, and the relatively long duration of the transitional period still constitute an appropriate atmosphere for the explosion of a new wave of youth violence in the Middle East.

This article first examines the political violence through the lens of political demography, drawing partly on Henrik Urdal’s theses on the impact of demographic factors on the risk of political violence, but more broadly documents and analyses the trajectory of youth movements’ involvement with violence in relation to issues of employment, education and urbanisation.

The Twitter Revolution in the Gulf Countries,2016,"The use of social media received a lot of ‘buzz’ due to the Arab Spring because of the events that unfurled in the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, among other places. However, although not as dramatic as overthrowing a current regime, the use of social media has been revolutionary in most areas of the Middle East, especially the most conservative societies that have been relatively closed to information that flowed without constraint. Saudi Arabia, for example, now has the largest growing Twitter community of all the nations in the Arabian Gulf. Known for its tight rein on public discourse and the flow of information, even elements of the current regime are opening doors to a new public discourse in large part due to the influence of social media. This project will explore the social media phenomenon that has had such an impact on the relatively closed societies of the Arab world, specifically on how it has changed the nature of public. The researcher used content analysis of four Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) journalist accounts and surveyed online research publications related to the subject from two different library databases that included hundreds of peer-reviewed academic journals. Also, the researcher conducted online keyword searches for information about research publications on the subject. The article concluded that the use of Twitter is shifting the Arab people discourse and opinion in the kingdom because those opinions are being heard instead of censored. Social media is having a major impact on the conservative Saudi, Qatar and UAE societies.

Modelling inflation shifts and persistence in Tunisia: perspectives from an evolutionary spectral approach,2015,"This article examines the dynamic characteristics of the inflation rate in Tunisia over the last two decades, and particularly following the onset of the Arab Spring in 2010 which causes distortions in this country’s monetary policy. We focus on the two specific dimensions of the Tunisian inflation rate: inflation regimes and persistence. We tackle this issue by adopting an evolutionary spectral approach, initially proposed by Priestley and Tong (1973). Our main findings indicate a stable inflation regime in the last 10 years, with an average inflation rate of around 5.5%. It is also found that the Tunisian inflation experienced a high degree of inertia which reflects its gradual responses to shocks. We also discuss the policy implications of these results, which typically require policy-makers to implement sound institutional reforms to reduce inflation.

Iron Age Nomads and their relation to copper smelting in Faynan (Jordan): Trace metal and Pb and Sr isotopic measurements from the Wadi Fidan 40 cemetery,2016,"The Faynan region in southern Jordan is the largest copper ore resource zone in the southern Levant and was exploited for these ores beginning ca. 8000 years BP. We discuss the relationship between nomadic populations and major copper smelting sites during the Iron Age (ca. 1200-500 BCE) based on mortuary excavations and toxic metal analyses at the Wadi Fidan 40 cemetery, the largest Iron Age mortuary complex in southern Jordan. The Iron Age represents the first industrial revolution in this part of the Middle East. The study presented here is the first to employ chemical and isotopic measurements from a systematically excavated Iron Age mortuary population to determine exposure to Cu and Pb pollution and mobility patterns (based on Sr isotopes). We describe a methodology to control for post-depositional diagenetic uptake of chemical elements in human teeth recovered from the cemetery that has not previously been applied in Faynan in ancient pollution studies. The results suggest that most of the excess of Pb and Cu measured in tooth enamel samples were a product of post-depositional diagenetic addition. Our findings suggest that the majority of people buried at the Wadi Fidan 40 cemetery were not exposed to metal pollution during their lives. The few individuals who were exposed to metal pollution exhibited a spectrum of traits indicative of lifestyle and social status. The results bring into question how severe the ancient pollution impacted the lives of the Iron Age population living in Faynan.

"Civics Lesson: Ambivalence, Contestation, and Curricular Change in Tunisia",2015,"ABSTRACT: Often credited with triggering the 2011 revolution that kicked off the ‘Arab Spring’, the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia once served as a unifying trope of citizen discontent with the state. Today however, many locals harbour ambivalent feelings towards Bouazizi's martyr status. This paper explores revolution-era deaths as they live on in Tunisia's current state history curricula. With the uprising not yet fully codified in state-sanctioned narratives of national history (yet indirectly encouraged), teachers are divided over how revolutionary events should be taught: many favour suspicion and informal contestation, instead of the foundational ‘death narratives’ they encounter, as vehicles for forging a collective sense of national belonging. This essay highlights the heteroglossic interplay between the informal mechanics of contention and the formal structures of the classroom, and locates suspicion as a vector for theorizing the imagined communities that emerge from sites of disagreement.

Lost in Iranoia: Saudi Arabia's struggle for regional hegemony in times of crisis,2016,"Saudi Arabia and Iran have been seeking regional supremacy due to political and ideological reasons since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Since 2011, these bilateral tensions have intensified with destabilising effects in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is influenced by 'Iranoia', which aims to counter the Iranian influence within the Arab region and to preserve the Saudi standing as a political and economic regional power as well as a religious role model. However, since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), Saudi Arabia has felt further betrayed by traditional allies such as the United States. The new Saudi leadership is concerned about the re-integration of Iran into the international community and thus has intensified its anti-Iran and anti-Shiite propaganda and policy in recent years.

Although all MNEs in Libya had to cultivate strong ties to Qadhafi to succeed during his 40 years of rule, we found that those that also invested in social-benefit projects and in social ties with families with few ties to the Qadhafi family earned a broad-based legitimacy that helped them survive Qadhafi's overthrow. Our findings contribute to the political risk and political behavior literature the notion that the pursuit of firm legitimacy in general, and especially in the eyes of social-sector actors, is an effective hedge against political risk. More theoretically, our findings support the addition of a social-sector-based path to firm legitimacy in the host country that complements and may at times substitute for, the government-based path to foreign firm legitimacy. Practically, our findings suggest that MNEs' facing severe political risk can improve their prospects for survival by investing in relationships with influential social groups and by offering goods or services that are perceived as socially valuable.

In the implicit formation of that cross-class and cross-ideological coalition that even-tually defeated the regime, a crucial role was played by workers' mobilizing against neoliberal policies. There are three main reasons for this: a) since the late 1990s workers were the most serious challenge to Mubarak's regime; b) during the now famous eighteen days of relentless protests, workers were at the fore-front in the Nile Delta centers, as well as an important element in Tahrir; and finally c) when public enter-prises were re-opened on February 6, an unprecedented wave of strikes paralyzed the country, forcing the military to oust Hosni Mubarak in order to deflect the growing social soul of the uprising.

Ihbat: disillusionment and the Arab Spring in Morocco,2016,"This paper provides a reading of Morocco's February 20th movement as an entry into the understanding of political failure experienced by a social movement. While there is an abundance of literature on successful movements, there seems to be little interest in unsuccessful ones. This may be explained by the fact that, unlike publically celebrated political victories, failure remains to a large extent contained within the private sphere. Accordingly, access to the inner dynamics of social movement failure is problematic for the researcher relying on conventional research methods and requires imaginative approaches. In this vein, fiction seems to enable a better engagement with this important facet of collective action. This paper proposes that the key in grasping the politics of failure is the discovery by activists that their belief in the idea of the ‘people always united until victory', which was a central mobilising force celebrated and performed on the streets during the short-lived euphoric phase,is flawed. Likewise, the consideration of the state as a paper tiger vulnerable in the face of an undefeatable peoples’ will is equally erroneous. Disillusionment,translated in the Arabic ihbat, captures the general mood of the post February 20th context. Far from the idealist expectations of radical change, the unfolding of the events produced disappointing results, revealed the disunity within the people, and unveiled the cunning side of state apparatuses and their ability to survive setbacks. Rather than considering ihbat as a static condition, the paper highlights the dynamics of alternative possibility generated by this emotion.

Syria’s economy is disintegrating both internally and externally, gradually becoming irrelevant for global trade in general and for the oil trade in particular and losing its place to its competitors in this field.

Towards a ‘democratic knowledge’ turn? Knowledge production in the age of the Arab Spring,2015,"This contribution (and the special issue as a whole) marks a modest attempt to initiate an investigation into what is called here ‘democratic knowledge’. This is done with special reference to the Arab Maghrib (in this instance Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt). This focus is deliberate. In the wake of the Arab Spring it is apposite to shed light on the potentiality of a ‘democratic turn’.

This is done with special reference to the Arab Maghrib (in this instance Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt). This focus is deliberate.

Bahrain: an R2P blind spot?,2015,"The ‘Arab Spring' has catalysed an intense debate about the efficacy of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). These debates have primarily focused on Libya and Syria; in this article I argue that the international community’s engagement with Bahrain, though generally overlooked, also has major implications for assessments of the contemporary efficacy of R2P. This article provides a brief overview of the 2011 uprising in Bahrain and events since before assessing whether Bahrain constitutes an ‘R2P situation'. Having concluded that Bahrain does meet the ‘R2P situation' criteria I detail how key actors integral to the implementation of R2P have engaged with Bahrain. In analysing this engagement I argue that Bahrain demonstrates that the permanent five members of the Security Council continue to prioritise national interests over the protection of human rights; that NGOs specifically focused on R2P apply the concept selectively; that R2P has not become a ‘lens' through which intra-state humanitarian crises are viewed; and that states can avoid international censure by undertaking certain policies which enable them to violate R2P’s principles without incurring significant costs.

The external dimension of Libya’s troubled transition: the international community and ‘democratic knowledge’ transfer,2015,"What are the sources of democratic knowledge in a context devoid of relevant experience and institutions? More than other Arab Spring states, Libya lacked the ingredients for successful democratisation. Yet, Libya's Arab Spring uprising was also unique in that external actors, Western and Arab, supported it through military intervention. Why was the international community's successful intervention to protect civilians and help overthrow the Qadhafi regime not translated into creating the conditions for stability, security, and the construction of democratic institutions after that regime fell? This article analyses the international dimension of Libya's transition and argues that the potential for external actors to be effective sources of democratic knowledge in post-Qadhafi Libya was severely constrained from the outset by the absence of leverage and linkages, two key factors highlighted in research on the international dimension of democratisation.

The article argues that, while the usual attempts to profit at the expense of other groups in society are still present and external patrons still wield great influence, the decision to postpone the elections also demonstrates a degree of pragmatism and political development since, despite dire predictions to the contrary, Lebanon has not succumbed to the return of its own civil war.

Contentious and Prefigurative Politics: Vigilante Groups' Struggle against Sexual Violence in Egypt (2011-2013),2015,"This article analyses the drivers, mobilizational tactics and manoeuvrings of informal, youth-led initiatives that emerged in post-Mubarak Egypt to counter the growing threat of sexual violence against women in public spaces. The findings are based on empirical research into youth-led activism against gender-based violence during 2011-2013. The approach adopted is a case study of three initiatives, Bassma (Imprint), Shoft Taharosh (Harassment Seen) and Opantish (Operation Anti Sexual Harassment). Informal youth-based initiatives in the context of the post-January 2011 uprising have generally been criticized for their lack of sustainability, organizationally and politically. However, the examination of activism against gender-based vio-lence through the lens of prefigurative politics shows the inherent value of experimentation and its contribution to innovations in public outreach. The value of the initiatives studied in this article also lies in their mobilizational power which inadvertently produces 'repertoires' of knowledge, skills and resources to engage the citizenry and capture their imagination. In the long run, such repertoires may allow for the emergence of organized and sustained forms of political agency. The article suggests that a cross-fertilization of prefigurative and contentious politics offers a framework for understanding temporally- and spatially-bound forms of collective political agency.

"Protests, Islamism and the waning prospect of revolution in Egypt",2015,"Popular uprisings across the Arab world from late 2010 soon transformed its political geography. Authoritarian regimes were confronted with challenges from their citizens. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak's security forces, epitomised by the Interior Ministry, had formerly managed to contain outbreaks of protests in the opening decade of the twenty-first century. However, the organising and mobilising of protests by groups such as Kefaya led to a wider social awareness of the looming prospect of the political inheritance of the office of president from father to son, cultivation of democratic ideals and values, and cross-ideological links expressed in a coalition of different political actors. The arrival of the Arab Spring in Egypt was inflected in this dissenting context. Broader regional trends held the promise of democratic transitions, at least persisting in Tunisia, which was somewhat dashed in the commotion generated by the rise of a secular-Islamist divide in Egypt's political scene. Familiar objections were raised against the very processes pushing forward the transition of democracy centred upon Islamist electoral successes. Secularism was contrasted with theocracy in the contest over who was the authentic guardian of the Egyptian revolution. Political acumen acquired in the struggle against the Mubarak regime, espousal of the norms of democracy and the transcending of ideological affiliations among Egypt's intelligentsia and activists appear to have been forgotten in the staking of political territory.

In this conceptualization, the targets of regime strategies play a central role, as their response to co-optation attempts is decisive for assessing success or failure. The contribution studies the well-known mechanisms of institutional-structural and material co-optation, complemented by traditional and identity-related co-optation to account for context-specific dynamics especially in Arab monarchies, but also beyond. The concept is applied to a case study of Jordan during the early phase of the Arab uprisings.

The Martyr Pop Moment: Depoliticizing Martyrdom,2015,"ABSTRACT: The military regime that seized power in Egypt in July 2013 has suggested that the security personnel, rather than the unarmed protestors who died in the 25 January 2011 uprising, were the martyrs that the nation should celebrate. This rhetorical claim in support of authoritarian suppression of dissent must be understood in the context of the popular culture of the immediate post-Mubarak period, particularly the ‘martyr pop’ music video clips. This mass-media form disseminated a strategically ambiguous rhetoric that celebrated the martyrs but largely ignored the political cause for which they died. Such depoliticization of martyrdom suited the sensibilities of the intellectual class, whose economic and political investments in the hegemony of the neoliberal state outweighed their stated commitments to political change.

The study specifically focuses on Egypt during the coup of July 2013, when President-elect Mohamed Morsi was overthrown by the army after weeks of protests. Through a qualitative content analysis based on the framing theory, we will look at the position of both channels regarding a coup emerging from popular uprisings and identify the differences between the two channels. The results show frames matching the definition of conflict (crisis and coup), military power and the legitimacy of democracy. As for divergences, it highlights CNN’s stance towards the coup as a necessary evil, while Al-Jazeera English takes a more Islamist approach and prefers to emphasize its democratic legitimacy. The transition to democracy in Egypt is not seen as a linear process of uninterrupted progress, but events such as the coup are seen as slight setbacks in the development of the conflict. These setbacks are a result of the dynamics of power in Egypt, where the military remain in charge above and beyond social movements.

This opens up to us an understanding of the indictment of Egypt's intellectual class that lies underneath the surface narrative. Utopia reflects upon the conditions that in a few years would lead to the street protests of 2011-12; it also shows, well before the fact, that such protests would only lead to further consolidation of power by the authoritarian regime.","Prefiguring Egypt's arab spring: Allegory and allusion in Ahmad Khālid Tawfīq's Utopia This paper examines Ahmad Khaiid Tawffq's 2008 novel Yutubiya [Utopia] in light of the many literary allusions made by one of its narrators.

"Islamism, secularism and the woman question in the aftermath of the arab spring: Evidence from the arab barometer",2016,"The uprisings that led to regime change during the early period of the Arab Spring were initially inclusive and pluralistic in nature, with men and women from every political and religious orientation engaging actively in political activities on the street and in virtual spaces. While there was an opening of political space for women and the inclusion of demands of marginalized groups in the activists’ agenda, the struggle to reimagine national identities that balance Islamic roots and secular yearnings is still ongoing in many countries in the region. This paper seeks to deepen understanding of the extent to which the pluralistic sentiments and openness to accepting the rights women have persisted following the uprising. We aim to examine changes in attitudes towards women’s equality in countries that underwent regime change through popular uprisings during revolutionary upheavals of the Arab Spring and in countries where regimes have remained unchanged. Using available data from consecutive rounds of the Arab Barometer survey, we examine changes in attitudes in nine countries with two rounds of Arab Barometer during and post Arab Spring (Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon, Sudan, Jordan, Iraq, Palestine). We find that support for ""Muslim feminism"" (an interpretation of gender equality grounded in Islam) has increased over the period and particularly in Arab Spring countries, while support for ""secular feminism"" has declined. In most countries examined, relatively high degrees of support for gender equality co-exist with a preference for Islamic interpretations of personal status codes1 pertaining to women. We discuss the implications of these findings for academics and activists concerned with women’s rights in the Middle East North Africa (MENA).

We discuss the implications of these findings for academics and activists concerned with women’s rights in the Middle East North Africa (MENA).

The Question of Education in the 2014 Tunisian Constitution: Article 39 and its Ambiguous Values,2016,"Despite Tunisia's remarkable transition from dictatorship to democracy following the Tunisian Revolution, only a few of the hotly debated articles in the country's new constitution have been analyzed by scholars. This article examines one of those under-analyzed constitutional provisions: Article 39, on education, whose language on religious and national values was repeatedly contested throughout the two-year drafting process. Using internal National Constituent Assembly documents and delegate voting records, the article explains how the education article transformed dramatically throughout drafting, ending in a controversial last-minute compromise accepted on the final day of voting. It provides insight on the broader constitution, which has been criticized for inconsistency, by showing how opposing interests largely amended the article's language into ambiguity. It also shows that the nca can be used as a model for exploring the convoluting impact quick votes in a constitution-making body's plenary assembly can have on work produced by the body's specialized committees.

This paper reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the major models and theories relevant to technology adoption: technology acceptance model, theory of reasoned action, technology-organisation environment, diffusion of innovation and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Also, the literature review shows the most common sequences in level of e-commerce adoption in SMEs: Rao model; Daniel model; Rayport and Jaworski model; Lefebvrea et al. model and leadership typologies. On the bases of these theories and models, a conceptual framework for SMEs' e-commerce adoption level in Jordan is suggested.

To better understand the roots of support for ISIS, we present a study using Twitter data. We collected a large number of Arabic tweets referring to ISIS and classified them as pro-ISIS or anti-ISIS. We then analyzed the historical timelines of both user groups and looked at their pre-ISIS period to gain insights into the antecedents of support. Also, we built a classifier to 'predict', in retrospect, who will support or oppose the group. We show that ISIS supporters largely differ from ISIS opposition in that the former referred a lot more to Arab Spring uprisings that failed than the latter.","#FailedRevolutions: Using Twitter to study the antecedents of ISIS support Lately, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has managed to control large parts of Syria and Iraq.

The Effect of Historical Pact Making and Civic Associations on Democratic Outcomes,2016,"Scholarship in comparative democratization finds that dialogue between the opposition and the old regime before the advent of democratic elections has consistently produced stable democracies least susceptible to reversals. This is because such “pacted” transitions promote values such as conciliation, compromise building, and consensus seeking. Yet the debate concerning how historical pact making affects the quality of democracy remains mainly anecdotal. Using a dataset of transitional states, I find that not all variants of pacted transitions facilitate consolidation. Pacted transitions initiated by the ancien régime are susceptible to democratic reversal, while transitions where the balance of power between the ancien régime and civic forces is equal in initiating regime change are associated with better democratic outcomes least susceptible to democratic collapse. The article also shows that regime transitions are very much influenced by other historical path-dependent factors—specifically the role of civic associations and coalitions during the transitional process.

The origins of labour autonomy in authoritarian Tunisia,2015,"Among the most remarkable things about the Tunisian revolution of 2011 was the role of the national trade union (UGTT). Joel Beinin has shown the critical importance this institutional power gave Tunisian workers in comparison to Egypt. I argue that its pre independence history is inadequate to understand this phenomenon given the weakness of Tunisian labour in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, it can be traced to elite political crises of the 1970s, relatively continuous base militancy from 1970 to 2011 and the collapse of state military relations in the early 1990s. I use State Department archives combined with data from the International Labor Organization and the Tunisian Ministry of Social Affairs to make this case. These results support the idea that co-optation of Tunisian unions was far less extensive than pre 2011 studies suggested, but that labour unrest was less widespread and less disruptive to strategic industries in comparison to 2011 and after.

This is particularly true for one of the most vibrant Sufi capitals of the Muslim world, Egypt, holding a record sum of more than 10 million Sufi members. In spite of this, however, one year after the Revolution in Egypt, political developments exhibited a pattern of failure of Sufis gaining political ground in the post-Mubarak political arena.

This study seeks to explore the Sufi experience throughout the process of political struggle, while examining their contributions to the November 2011 elections in an attempt to unveil the factors culminating in their political setback in spite of their massive membership base, and the official favored support of the state, both on the local and international fronts. The study concludes that the nature of the Sufi practice itself contributed to a restraining of their political presence, in addition to their lack of political awareness, poor organization and populism, all of which acted critically toward creating a failed political journey for the Sufi orders in modern Egypt.

A method for discovery and analysis of temporal patterns in complex event data,2015,"Pattern analysis techniques currently common within geography tend to focus either on characterizing patterns of spatial and/or temporal recurrence of a single event type (e.g., incidence of flu cases) or on comparing sequences of a limited number of event types where relationships between events are already represented in the data (e.g., movement patterns). The availability of large amounts of multivariate spatiotemporal data, however, requires new methods for pattern analysis. Here, we present a technique for finding associations among many different event types where the associations among these varying event types are not explicitly represented in the data or known in advance. This pattern discovery method, known as T-pattern analysis, was first developed within the field of psychology for the purpose of finding patterns in personal interactions. We have adapted and extended the T-pattern method to take the unique characteristics of geographic data into account and implemented it within a geovisualization toolkit for an integrated computational-geovisual environment we call STempo. To demonstrate how T-pattern analysis can be employed in geographic research for discovering patterns in complex spatiotemporal data, we describe a case study featuring events from news reports about Yemen during the Arab Spring of 2011–2012. Using supplementary data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, we briefly summarize and reference a separate validation study, then evaluate the scalability of the T-pattern approach. We conclude with ideas for further extensions of the T-pattern technique to increase its utility for spatiotemporal analysis.

We have adapted and extended the T-pattern method to take the unique characteristics of geographic data into account and implemented it within a geovisualization toolkit for an integrated computational-geovisual environment we call STempo. To demonstrate how T-pattern analysis can be employed in geographic research for discovering patterns in complex spatiotemporal data, we describe a case study featuring events from news reports about Yemen during the Arab Spring of 2011–2012. Using supplementary data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, we briefly summarize and reference a separate validation study, then evaluate the scalability of the T-pattern approach. We conclude with ideas for further extensions of the T-pattern technique to increase its utility for spatiotemporal analysis. ",['yem'],CW,False,True,False,0
"Rethinking foreign military interventions to promote human rights: Evidence from Libya, Bahrain and Syria",2015,"Scholarly opinions on the linkages between foreign military interventions and human rights promotions or violations are highly divided across the board. While many scholars see military interventions as effective means to save and promote human lives and rights from the clutches of repressive regimes, others reject such interventions as harmful to domestic reconciliations and rights promotions. The Arab Spring has renewed the debates between the liberal enthusiasts who staunchly supported NATO's military intervention to free up the Libyans from the Gaddafi regime and the critics who saw creeping dangers in this new intervention, ostensibly inspired by the responsibility to protect doctrine. This paper investigates the issue of Arab Spring-led foreign direct and indirect military interventions in Libya, Bahrain and Syria and critically examines the consequences of interventions for improvements or decline in Arab human rights conditions. Its findings support the position of the anti-intervention scholars that foreign military interventions produce deleterious effects on human rights in the target states.

"Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Qatar and dispute mediations: a critical investigation",2015,"This paper investigates the role played by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in mediating disputes since its creation in 1981 to 2011, the year of the outbreak of the ‘Arab Spring’. It analyzes the contributions of the GCC as a conflict mediator by cross-checking this sub-regional group's institutional structure and policy approach, and presents two major findings. Firstly, the GCC was hardly designed as a conflict mediator, given that the Gulf Arab states created it as a vehicle to respond to intra-Gulf and external security threats and challenges. Secondly, in order to promote its foreign policy independence and boost its regional and global diplomatic profile to ensure its security and survival in the dangerous environment of the Gulf region, it is Qatar that has extensively attempted to mediate conflicts in Lebanon, Yemen and Sudan, with varying degrees of success, under the banners of the GCC and the Arab League. Finally, the paper presents a series of policy recommendations, based on critical insights from Qatari mediation experiences, to enable the GCC to be a proactive dispute mediator.

Protecting the sacred: Tunisia’s Islamist movement ennahdha and the challenge of free speech,2015,"Since the 2011 uprising, Tunisia’s Islamist movement Ennahdha has proposed a political project based on reclaiming the nation’s Arab-Islamic identity. At the heart of this is the issue of ‘protection of the sacred’, which seeks to define limits to freedom of expression to protect religious symbols from criticism. This is part of Ennahdha’s post-Islamist evolution. The movement has drawn away from its earlier ambitions to Islamise the state and now seeks to reconstruct the role of Islam by asserting a cultural Islamic identity, which recasts religious norms as conservative values and which has yet to determine the precise limits of new individual freedoms. The result was to propose a new set of rules for the community under which Tunisians would freely express their religious belief in a way denied them under the former regime, but would also live under a state that defended and guaranteed their religious values.

Political Instrumentalization of Islam in a Violent State Crisis: The Case of Syria,2015,"A misconception has emerged in the empirical literature about the nature of the relationship between politics and Islam. It has been assumed that Islam, based on specific features in the Islamic religion and culture, had dominated politics in the Middle East, thus Islamic movements and formations have been responsible for the increase of political use of Islam overlooking the role of the state in pushing religion into the political domain. This article attempts to analyze the reasons of why political instrumentalization of Islam increases in the Syrian violent conflict showing that the prominence of Islamic rhetoric does not owe to specific features of the Islamic religion and culture but rather to the exploitation of religion in mobilization, contestation, and outbidding processes. Politics dominate religion in the Syrian conflict. Political instrumentalization of Islam is more likely to remain on the rise in the Syrian violent crisis causing serious implications on peace building and leading to a political vicious cycle that increases radicalization, deepens division, and hampers political development toward political reconciliation. The state instrumentalized religion from the early days of the uprising. Insurgent formations have become fragmented based on Islamic interpretations.

El Harka: Perceptions of the Migration-Development Nexus in Post-Revolution Tunis,2015,"In the 3 years since the ousting of Tunisia's dictator Zine El Abedine Ben Ali in January 2011, net emigration from Tunisia has doubled, suggesting a link between revolutionary politics and aspirations to emigrate. A large proportion of this emigration has taken the form of a clandestine crossing to Europe, locally called El Harka. This paper explores the complex interactions between the 'migration-development nexus' and revolutionary national politics in the aspirations of Tunisian young men to emigrate in the post-Revolution period. I use the sociologist Albert O. Hirschman's concept of 'Exit-Voice-Loyalty' to come to an understanding of the geographical imaginaries and spatial practices expressed by individual Tunisian men in relation to migration. I present my findings within a typology of 'surplus', 'circulation', and 'engagement' to describe the ways in which the inherent politics of migration are expressed. 'Surplus' emerged as a powerful discourse in post-Revolution Tunis, leading to politically significant notions of migrant identity. 'Circulation' denotes the developmental ideal held in tension with concerns over legality. I argue that the primacy of illegal emigration from Tunisia indicates the dominance of exploitative migration policies. Finally, political 'engagement' in the post-Revolution period is theorised to correlate to disinterest in emigration. The institution of freedom of expression is argued to increase 'loyalty', through privileging 'voice' over 'exit' as a course of action for the discontent.

Public health challenges in the political economy of conflict: The case of Syria,2015,"Recent uprisings in the Arab world and a full-scale war in Syria are widely viewed as popular demand for political voice against repressive regimes. However, growing economic inequalities and serious economic dysfunction played a role as trigger for conflict than is commonly accepted. Tunisia, Egypt and Syria all implemented policies of liberalization over the past two decades, leading to the worsening of living standards for the majority. The various forms of liberalization played a significant role in embedding social division and discontent whose outcomes affected other countries of the region with the onset of market reforms in nascent welfare states. Egypt, for example, was viewed by the World Bank as an economic 'best performer', despite regular riots over food prices, job losses and land expropriation for tourism. Tunisia was praised by donors just prior to the uprising (in 2010), for 'weathering well' the global economic downturn through 'sound macroeconomic management'. In Syria, the market economy made its mark over the 90s, but macroeconomic adjustment policies were implemented in a bilateral agreement with the European Union and approved by the International Monetary Fund in 2003. The economic stabilization programme that followed had limited concern for social impacts such as jobs losses, price rises and national debt, which ultimately caused immense hardship for the population at large, acting as a trigger for the initial uprising in 2011, prior to its transformation into a fully blown conflict. This article focuses on reforms implemented in the health sector and sets these in the context of the current political economy of Syria.

The recent Arab uprising has been associated with considerable damage to infrastructure and loss of human lives. The aim of this study was to determine mortality, injuries and population displacement that occurred during the recent Libyan armed conflict. Methods: A systematic cross-sectional field survey and non-structured search was carried out over fourteen provinces in six Libyan regions, representing the primary sites of the armed conflict between February 2011 and February 2012. Thirty-five percent of the total area of Libya and 62.4% of the Libyan population were involved in the study. The mortality and injury rates were determined and the number of displaced people was calculated during the conflict period. Results: A total of 21,490 (0.5%) persons were killed, 19,700 (0.47%) injured and 435,000 (10.33%) displaced. The overall mortality rate was found to be 5.1 per 1000 per year (95% CI 4.1-7.4) and injury rate was found to be 4.7 per 1000 per year (95% CI 3.9-7.2) but varied by both region and time, reaching peak rates by July-August 2011. Conclusion: The Libyan armed conflict resulted in great human loss and social damage mirrored by high rates of mortality, injury and human displacement. Such parameters peaked as the conflict escalated and differed according to the Libyan regions and provinces involved.

The outcome is the rendering of Tunisian and Egyptian socio-economic development open to enterprise-based, calculative and professionalised operations that make local conditions serviceable to neoliberal governing patterns, linkages and practices of business, capital production and investment.

Comparing these two very different cases illustrates the utility of a typology of civil society actors (CSAs) that (a) emphasizes temporary coalitions between diverse actors; (b) highlights the both contentious and collaborative struggles through which political change actually happens; and (c) recognizes that different types of CSAs face different constraints and opportunities. I argue that employing such a typology can help structure comparison between disparate cases of civil society efforts for democratization and bring to the forefront issues of authenticity and legitimacy – challenges emanating not only from an oppressive state, but from within civil society itself.

Inter- and intra-party relations in the formation of the Benkirane coalition governments in Morocco,2015,"This article analyses inter- and intra-party relations in the formation of coalition governments in Morocco after the elections held in November 2011, and presided over by Abdelilah Benkirane. Although coalition theory has been applied in democratic contexts, we consider that the study of government coalitions, and in particular of party relations, is also important in hybrid political systems, in which there is significant room for political competition and participation. The methodology of the study is principally based on interviews carried out with members of the Moroccan Government, among them the Head of Government, and also with leaders and members of the parties in the government coalition and in opposition. The comments of these actors are discussed with reference to the academic literature. The results of the research show that despite the limits on democracy in Morocco, there are important interactions between the political parties, which can be seen in the form of alliances, consensus building, the distribution of power, and splits. In this political manoeuvring, ideology plays a secondary role. The context of the Arab Spring does not affect the coalition building, even though the national interest is found in the parties' political discourse for justifying their entry to the government. Thus, the most significant aspect of participation in Government is the acquisition of power and party's strategic interests. Looking at internal party dynamics, we also see that internal factors affect decisions as to whether to participate in government or not. Lastly, despite the reforms carried out in the wake of the Arab Spring, Mohammed VI continues to exert his influence on the formation of the Government. Nevertheless, the parties participating in the government coalition show their acceptance of the current rules of the political system, in which a significant executive role is reserved for the Monarchy. ","Inter- and intra-party relations in the formation of the Benkirane coalition governments in Morocco This article analyses inter- and intra-party relations in the formation of coalition governments in Morocco after the elections held in November 2011, and presided over by Abdelilah Benkirane. Although coalition theory has been applied in democratic contexts, we consider that the study of government coalitions, and in particular of party relations, is also important in hybrid political systems, in which there is significant room for political competition and participation.

"Virtual Uprisings: On the Interaction of New Social Media, Traditional Media Coverage and Urban Space during the ‘Arab Spring’",2015,"This article analyses the geography of urban uprising during the so-called Arab Spring, with a focus on the relationship between its virtual and physical dimensions. To enhance understanding of contemporary social movements, it pays particular attention to the interwoven relationship between the social media that now organise gatherings and communicate political messages, the practices of protest in urban space and the magnifying power of global and national media. Using case studies from Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen, it analyses the spatial and temporal aspects of recent protests and suggests that the reciprocal interaction between social media, urban space and traditional media does not simply reproduce relations between these actors, but also transforms them incrementally.

Capacity-building for the transformation of public service: A case of managerial-level public servants in Egypt,2015,"The past few years have witnessed a wave of unrest in Egypt toppling down two regimes in less than three years. Yet was this sufficient to bringing the demanded change and meeting people’s expectations? In several Arab countries, citizens are offered patronage through public sector employment, subsidies, and limited taxation (Razzaz and Razzaz, 2012). The social contract imbalance offers little support to citizen voice and representation of all segments of society in holding governments accountable. Given the numerous challenges ranging from an overinflated bureaucracy resulting from the guaranteed employment since Nasser’s era, to the declining quality of the available pool of workers and to regulations that hinder its development, capacity building of would pose as one of the least costly areas of potential quick reform (Beissinger et al, 2013; El Baradei and Newcomer, 2008; ETF, 2011; Radwan, 2012; World Bank, 2013).

The methodology utilized depends on a literature review of primary and secondary sources for grounded theory qualitative research on capacity building and institutional enabling factors. The findings are linked to a qualitative analysis to probe the perceptions of public service mid-career managerial level professionals and to identify their perceived expectations of whether training institutions would be effective in transforming public service. Managerial levels were selected to enable probing the commitment of institutions. Two empirical tools were utilized: interviews and surveys. The first tool was a number of in-depth face-to-face structured interviews conducted with 24 informed sources representing senior managerial level public service managers. The second tool was a survey which was distributed both online and in hard copy. The survey targeted a purposive sample of 350 mid-managerial level public service managers of which 324 were received.

This argument rests on an analysis of information gathering in Western embassies before, during and after the eighteen days of the revolt that ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. I first identify various practices influencing diplomatic knowledge and prompting the production of particular interpretations of the revolt in Egypt. I then analyze how actors manage multiple positions and dispositions within overlapping social fields. This point illustrates what practice theorists mean when they assert that agents are always speaking from a position. Overall, the article unravels what being a diplomat posted abroad actually consists of in practice, complementing existing studies on the diplomatic mode of knowledge production.

While distorting the struggles and complexity of Egyptian history and heritage, the textbooks construct patriotic devotion and a form of docile 'neoliberal Islamism' as the route to national renaissance. They present a notion of ideal citizenship where personal piety, charity and entrepreneurship are the proposed solutions to 'Egypt's problems'. However, to actually relieve its 'problems', the regime has relied on religious associations for the provision of social services, depended on significant foreign assistance and periodically activated anti-western nationalism.

Cocreating the Arab Spring: Understanding Transformation of Service Systems in Contention,2015,"This article examines the transformation of service systems through actors’ resource integration and value cocreation in contention. It is based on a netnographic study focusing on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) tools by online activists during the “Arab Spring.” The transformation of service systems is conceptualized on the basis of existing service research and on the theory of strategic action fields. Focusing on Syria, the findings suggest that activists transformed four interdependent service systems—the media, the social movement, health care, and the financial service systems—during the Arab Spring by means of integrating resources and cocreating value within several ICT tools. A key contribution to transformative service research is the fact that the positive transformation of service systems derives from the conflict between two types of actors, namely, incumbents and challengers. This article also contributes to our knowledge of triggers of service system transformation, what motivates actors to transform service systems, how service system transformation is enabled by actors’ integration and use of ICT tools serving as opportunity spaces, and the transformative roles actors adopt. In addition, this article contributes to the conceptualization of service systems and to the understanding of resource integration and value cocreation.

How the media trashed the transitions,2015,"The media played a key role in mobilizing the Arab uprisings of 2010–11, but played a far more negative role in the transitions which ensued. Rather than constituting new public spheres for the negotiation of new identities and institutions, or acting as watchdogs on the emergent regimes, the media in most Arab states contributed to social polarization, popular discontent, and the resurgence of old regimes. While the potentially destructive role of media can be found in all attempted democratic transitions, the Arab cases had several unique characteristics, including the prominent role of transnational broadcasting, the new social media environment, and divisive questions about Islamist movements. This article traces the role of the media in the Arab transitions across three distinct levels: transnational broadcasting, domestic public and private broadcasting, and social media. All three played destructive roles, with transnational television becoming a weapon for proxy wars by regional powers, national media being captured by old elites and private interests, and social media encouraging polarization and informational clustering. Very similar patterns emerge in Egypt and Tunisia, the two key potential democratic transitions following the Arab uprisings.

Yet have non-Islamist parties really been superior agents of democratic change? We test this by surveying secular parties in three countries: Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey. In order to assess each party’s liberal credentials, we analyze each along four key dimensions:1) history of exclusivist and statist positions; 2) ties to the military; 3) past political behavior; and 4) internal party democracy.

A commitment to politics: the trajectory of the Muslim Brotherhood during Egypt's 2011–13 political opening,2015,"Prior to the 2011 Arab uprisings, Islamist parties in most Arab states had been systematically prevented from exercising any meaningful authority in government. Following President Hosni Mubarak's ousting from power in 2011, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB) established a political party – the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) – and formally entered mainstream politics, providing a rare opportunity to examine the role of an Islamist party in the context of democratic transition. Contrary to concerns that the MB might use Egypt's political opening to install an undemocratic regime, the movement instead committed itself to electoral politics and consistently adhered to the framework for political transition. An analysis of the MB's political trajectory during the 2011–13 timeframe reveals that the movement endeavoured to protect Egypt's democratic transition against the encroachment of the military and the judiciary. Despite the FJP's efforts, sustained interference by non-elected institutions brought Egypt's democratic experiment to a premature end. This course of events confirms that an Islamist movement is capable of fully committing to politics, but also indicates that political commitment alone is insufficient to ensure a successful transition to democratic governance.

Enforcing ‘Our Law’ When the State Breaks Down: The Case of Protection Economies in Libya and Their Political Consequences,2015,"Much has been written about the challenges of rebuilding state institutions in the wake of conflict, or in the context of weak or failing states. There has however been much less attention paid to how local forms of governance develop, strengthen and evolve in the absence of state institutions. Our argument is that a key analytical tool for understanding this process is through the lens of ‘protection economies’, which have become a key dimension of most modern conflicts. These are the ability of armed actors to generate revenue and consolidate territorial control through the provision of protection around both licit and illicit resource flows. The result is the strengthening of some actors over others, while undercutting the prospects for longer term stability or state consolidation, given that providers of protection often have more to gain from the evolving ‘protection economy’ than from political compromise or peace. We demonstrate this through an examination of how localised protection economies have developed around smuggling and trafficking markets, and how this has contributed to the implosion of the state in Libya. The article draws from extensive fieldwork in Libya during 2011–2013, a crucial period in which the central state and legitimate democratic process was under considerable strain from competing localised militia groups. Arguably, the roots of the current governance crisis can be traced to the way that protection economies strengthened the role of certain actors in local governance, thereby fragmenting territorial control over the country.

Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,2015,"Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011, the greater Fertile Crescent experienced the most severe drought in the instrumental record. For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.","Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011, the greater Fertile Crescent experienced the most severe drought in the instrumental record.

Eighty three workers from eight silica quarries in the Nafusa Mountains of Libya opted to participate. These quarries were working the upper cretaceous geological structure. Eighty-five individuals who lived in Gharyan City with no affiliation to quarry operations participated as controls. Spirometry variables evaluated were Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume at 1.0 second (FEV1), FVC/FEV1 and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Control and exposed groups had no differences in terms of height, weight, or smoking status (p = 0.18, 0.20, 0.98, respectively). Prior to adjustment for other variables, FVC, FEV1, and PEF are all significantly lower in the exposed group (p = 0.003, 0.009, 0.03, respectively). After adjustment for age, height, weight, and smoking status, there remain significant differences between the control and exposed groups for FVC, FEV1, and PEF. This analysis demonstrated that exposure to quarry dust has a detrimental effect on lung function, and that pre-revolution Libyan quarry workers were being exposed. This study shows that any exposure is harmful, as the reduction in lung function was not significantly associated with years of exposure.

Post-traumatic stress disorder and psychiatric comorbidity in a sample of Egyptian adolescents after the revolution: A cross-sectional study,2015,"Background Trauma experienced by adolescents has considerable importance because significant physical and emotional growth occurs at this age. With the events of the Arab Spring and the Egyptian revolution in 2011, many adolescents faced highly challenging and dramatic life events. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was clinically noticed in this group of patients. Aim Because of the scarcity of research during this critical period, we aimed to determine the occurrence of PTSD in a sample of adolescent students in Tanta in order to assess their level of anxiety and study comorbid disorders. Methodology A total of 423 adolescents were randomly selected from both public and private schools with random selection of the participating classes. The enrolled students were subjected to the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale to determine the level of anxiety, to the PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview as a diagnostic interview for PTSD and associated comorbidities. Results PTSD was seen in 16.31% of students, which was highly significantly more among female students compared with male students (P=0.006).

Human rights and power amid protest and change in the Arab world,2015,"The stunning popular uprisings in the Arab world in 2011 inaugurated an era of protest, revolutions and political transitions, on the one hand, and heightened repression, civil war and renewed authoritarianism, on the other. During this era the human rights paradigm was often at the fore of political and social contests, repeatedly being claimed, co-opted and appropriated. This paper argues that within the Middle East’s uprisings and transitions, deployments of human rights had notable emancipatory effects; yet invocations of the discourse continued to emerge from, converge with or (re)produce various power-laden domestic and international political dynamics. The human rights paradigm served as a primary discourse of the most serious challenge to Arab authoritarianism and its Western sponsorship in contemporary history, with the outcome in Tunisia exemplifying its potential to influence both the processes and substance of genuine political change. The period’s events and ethos also created openings for rights claims to be made by marginalised groups and facilitated local actors’ agency in driving the region’s human rights politics and agendas after decades of ‘human rights in the Arab world’ being a discourse largely driven by foreign actors. Yet the paradigm was also frequently curtailed or instrumentalised by local rulers and Western powers clinging to longstanding authoritarian arrangements, as well as by emergent political actors vying for power.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the 2011 Yemeni revolution on hospital disaster preparedness in the capital city of Sana'a. Methods: The study was conducted in September 2011 and 2013. For evaluation purposes, the hospital emergency response checklist published by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used. Additional information was also obtained to determine what steps were being taken by hospital authorities to improve hospital preparedness. Results: The study selected 11 hospitals.

At the second evaluation, 5 hospitals were rated ""unacceptable,"" 3 ""insufficient,"" and 1 ""effective,"" receiving a rating of 9 to 134. Conclusions: Unfortunately, this study shows that between 2011 and 2013, no significant progress was made in hospital disaster preparedness in Sana'a.

Additional information was also obtained to determine what steps were being taken by hospital authorities to improve hospital preparedness. Results: The study selected 11 hospitals. At the time of the first evaluation, 7 hospitals were rated ""unacceptable"" for level of preparedness and 4 were rated ""insufficient,"" receiving a WHO checklist rating of 10 to 98. At the second evaluation, 5 hospitals were rated ""unacceptable,"" 3 ""insufficient,"" and 1 ""effective,"" receiving a rating of 9 to 134. Conclusions: Unfortunately, this study shows that between 2011 and 2013, no significant progress was made in hospital disaster preparedness in Sana'a. In a disaster-prone country like Yemen, the current situation calls for drastic improvement. Health system authorities must take responsibility for issuing strategic plans as well as standards, guidelines, and procedures to improve hospital disaster preparedness.

Undermining the transatlantic democracy agenda? The Arab Spring and Saudi Arabia's counteracting democracy strategy,2015,"Saudi Arabian foreign policy is often declared to be countering the possible democratic transitions of the Arab Spring. As such, Saudi Arabia has been cast as a “counter-revolutionary” force in the Middle East and North Africa. This article explores the extent to which this has been the case in Egypt and Bahrain, and the extent to which Saudi foreign policy has challenged United States and European Union democracy promotion efforts in those countries. The article highlights how the transatlantic democracy promotion strategy is complicated by a conflict of interests problem, which leads them to promote democracy on an ad hoc and incremental basis. As a result, their efforts and larger strategic thinking are undermined by Saudi Arabia in Egypt. However, in Bahrain, transatlantic democracy promotion is itself muted by the strategic interest in containing Iran. As a result, Saudi Arabia can be seen as a regional countervailing power but this is implicitly in line with transatlantic policy. Tensions with Saudi foreign policy in Bahrain are over how best to manage the uprisings and maintain the status quo, rather than a conflict over political transition.

Assessments of Turkish Foreign Policy in the Middle East During the Arab Uprisings,2015,"Abstract: Using original public-opinion polls and elite interviews conducted in 2012, this article analyzes the perceptions of Turkish foreign policy regarding the Arab Uprisings and the Syrian conflict in three Middle Eastern countries, Egypt, Iraq and Iran. It finds that ethnic, sectarian and religious groups in these three countries vary significantly in their views on Turkish foreign policy regarding both the Arab Uprisings and the Syrian conflict, although the same identity-related factors have a less salient effect at the elite level. The findings also suggest that the intersection of ethnicity and sect shapes people's attitudes toward Turkish foreign policy in Iran and Iraq. Sunnis, except for Kurds in Iran and Iraq, tend to have a positive view of Turkish foreign policy, while Shia Turkomans in Iraq tend to have a negative one.

To Repress or Not to Repress—Regime Survival Strategies in the Arab Spring,2015,"Authoritarian regimes use repression as an essential strategy to attain regime stability and survival. During the Arab Spring, different forms of repression have been employed. We argue that to explain this variation, three bundles of characteristics have to be taken into account: the setup of the regime, the state, and the challenge. As we assume that elites have a wider repertoire of strategies besides repression at their disposal, the analysis of repression has to be embedded in a broader framework of strategies of rule. Including specific forms and target groups of repression, we develop an explanatory model addressing the question of which repressive measures rulers utilize under which circumstances. The postulated relationship between repression and characteristics of the state, regime, and challenge are then tested in a comparative analysis of the reactions to the challenges arising with the 2011 uprisings in two very different Arab countries, Bahrain and Egypt. On the basis of these empirical findings, we propose a readjusted model explaining repression.

Beyond the Arab Spring: Evaluating Libya's long-term tourism prospects,2015,"Before the 'Arab Spring' that spread to Libya in early 2011, international tourism to the country had been increasing gradually for two decades. However, in the wake of the civil war, international tourism arrivals plummeted. Following the demise of the Gaddafi regime, the interim government reasserted Libya's commitment to international tourism growth and openness to the global economy, only to see the country once more descend into unrest and division. This paper assesses the long-term prospects for Libya's international tourism recovery, within a current context of increasing political instability and violence. The paper argues that a major factor inhibiting tourism growth has been the relatively poor quality of service in Libyan 4- and 5-star hotels. It goes on to explore possible strategies to improve the quality of service, concluding with an assessment of Libya's long-term potential to achieve 'international' standards of service quality and the wider implications that may be drawn from the paper's findings.

Sectarianism and the Arab Spring: Framing the popular protests in Bahrain,2015,"Inspired by the events of the Arab Spring, political activists in Bahrain organized an anti-government demonstration on 14 February 2011, which resulted in the death of one protestor. Hundreds of other protests followed, and popular anger against the Sunni monarchy is still a vital issue in the Kingdom. From the earliest stages, the Bahraini government, which is closely aided by other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, framed the protests as an Iran-backed conspiracy against the Gulf in an attempt to spread Shiism and infiltrate into the region. This sectarian dimension became the dominant frame in order to discredit the cause of the mostly Shiite protestors who were asking for equal rights and job opportunities. This study investigates the different issues and sentiments framed by the commentators as well as the main online communities that were present.

The case for cognitive interviewing techniques in the post-Arab Spring environment,2015,"Many social scientists rely on survey data, such as the World Values Survey and the Arab Barometer, to measure individual political attitudes cross-nationally. Yet, research suggests that individuals' political attitudes fluctuate and evolve, casting doubt on the validity of survey data when used alone. This is especially problematic during times of rapid change, when the political situation undergoes dramatic shifts and individual attitudes are easily influenced by current events. This essay proposes that using cognitive interviewing techniques, which involve asking respondents to answer a set of survey items along with follow-up probes about their answers, can help researchers better understand the content of political attitudes and the contexts that help shape them. To make this point, I first review the literature on the theoretical problems with measuring political attitudes during times of rapid political change. I then introduce cognitive interviewing as a mixed-method data collection technique, describe the challenges and difficulties associated with it, and offer a number of practical recommendations for researchers interested in using it in the post-Arab Spring environment. Finally, I demonstrate the effectiveness of cognitive interviewing techniques through examples drawn from my fieldwork in Tunisia between August 2013 and March 2014.

Qatar and the Arab Spring: down the foreign policy slope,2015,"Qatar, a backwater state in regional and international politics until 1995, has in recent years pursued a high-profile foreign policy in the areas of dispute mediations, maintaining balanced relations with allies and adversaries alike, adept use of soft power tools, and even military interventions in fellow Arab states, Libya in particular, to aid the Arab pro-democracy forces. This high-profile foreign policy has aimed at strengthening Qatar's national security in the Gulf neighbourhood and playing a more proactive role in the Arab world. This article examines Qatar's activist foreign policy role in the Arab Spring and probes whether such a role is sustainable in future in view of the constraints Qatar faces at home, in the Gulf neighbourhood and beyond.

Alternative fabrics of hegemony: City squares and street graffiti as sites of resistance and interactive communication flow,2015,"This article discusses the symbolic use of town squares and street walls as sites of communicative spaces. This approach looks at the PR role of those locations, i.e. the discourse and the imagery (portrayed in public spaces, graffiti images and street wall writings) that permeate those communicative domains. The obvious motive of their expansion across various cities is to contest the mainstream media and PR industries in favour of a more interactive flow of information in society. Similarly to the stress put by few scholars on the significance of urban spaces in global cities, this article considers the symbolic power of public spaces in Tunisia during and after the revolution of 14 January 2011 as sites of social activism, which may sometimes rival the power of social media networks. I examine its multifaceted forms of youth action in Tunisia to probe the forms of power that have led to current social changes. The study reveals that such squares have played significant roles in developing social relations, establishing connections and building friendships between social groups. After the revolution such spaces have emerged as contested terrains redefined by the new social order. Also graffiti and street art have, on the one hand, signalled the flourishing of a multiplicity of voices that are serving as a watchdog to the Transition to Democracy. On the other hand, such forms of social activism have proven to be effective tools for breaking the government’s monopoly on information dissemination, public opinion and control over the communicative spheres.

Understanding abusive child labor practices in the shadow of the Arab spring,2015,"Purpose: The Syrian civil war that forced hundreds of thousands of Syrian women and children into Jordan as refugees dramatically increased the number of child labourers in that country. The current investigation aims to establish a body of knowledge on the issues surrounding child labour in Jordan by providing an exploratory diagnosis of the phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to explore verbal and physical abusive practices towards working children and investigate whether there are differences between the treatment of domestic and Syrian refugee child labourers. Design/methodology/approach: The research design is quantitative; however, we use a qualitative technique to support and expand the research findings. Data were collected from 124 Jordanian and Syrian working children over a seven-month period in 2013. Findings: The results reveal that it is poverty that forces Jordanian children into work while Syrian children are driven by the need for asylum. Of the abusive practices directed towards working children, verbal abuse is the most common. Older children, children from unstable families and those who work long hours are more vulnerable to this form of abuse, while children from unstable family structures and who work long hours are more likely to experience physically abuse. The results reveal that Syrian children are paid much less, are less verbally abused, had better schooling and perceive working conditions more positively than do their Jordanian counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this research arise from the size the sample. Social implications: The current study aims to raise awareness about the importance of preventing abusive practices towards local and refugee children working in Jordan. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, very little is known about refugee child labour and how it might differ from domestic child labour.

Sufi Springs: Air on an Oud String,2015,"The initial part of Caroline Rooney's essay offers an incisive account of the author's experience of Cairo in the years leading up to the 2011 uprisings that led to the end of Hosni Mubarak's rule. Rooney's narrative evinces an active Downtown cosmopolitan spirit characterised by a burgeoning sense of 'audacity' in forms of arts activism, and its attendant collective spirit of perseverance that increasingly rendered ineffective the repressive manoeuvres of Egypt's disciplinary State. Criticising the impulse to construe the Egyptian revolution in terms of a mimetic desire for a secular democracy on Western lines, Rooney insists that the Arab uprisings consisted, in many respects, of a revolution against Western-style free market neoliberalism. Countering the perpetual cynicism attendant to the latter, Rooney argues, requires a form of politicisation that maintains 'the ongoing presence of the real as a matter of collective spirit' - one that can outlast the colonial interlude by resisting the absolutist self-assertion of market fundamentalism and its collusions with 'diplo-economic cosmopolitanism' as a mode of class-discriminatory privilege, as well as the compromising nature of right-wing Islam. Rooney moves on to locate a counter-movement based on an alternative form of consciousness that manifests itself 'as solidarity, as resoluteness, as genuine comradeship, as collective consciousness, as revolutionary faith and [as] festiveness.' In the last part of her essay, Rooney raises the intriguing case of Sufism, and specifically its mulid rituals and its important role in the Egyptian revolutionary effort, as a relational cultural mode that can survive the will-to-dominance as a persistent and liberatory collective gesture.

"Long-term monarchical survival in the Middle East: a configurational comparison, 1945–2012",2015,"The survival of eight monarchies during the “Arab Uprisings” has put centre stage the fundamental question about the durability of this subtype of authoritarian regime. Seen from a broader historical perspective, however, the idea that monarchies have an inherent advantage in retaining power is less evident: a number of authoritarian monarchies broke down and subsequently became republics (Egypt 1952, Iraq 1958, North Yemen 1962, Libya 1969, Iran 1979), while others survived (Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). To account for these divergent long-term pathways we systematically compare the 13 current and former Middle East monarchies. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we concentrate on five central explanatory factors derived from previous research – namely, external support, rent revenues, family participation, the monarch's claim to legitimate rule, and hard repression. Our findings highlight the existence of three broad pathways to monarchical survival – linchpin monarchies, like Jordan and Morocco, versus the dynastic Gulf monarchies – and also reveal a possible hybrid third pathway, one which shares linchpin characteristics, but relates to cases on the Arabian Peninsula (Oman and the historical Imamate in North Yemen).

"Periphery Discourse: An Alternative Media Eye on the Geographical, Social and Media Peripheries in Egypt’s Spring",2015,"The growing literature on the use of social media for social protests generally, and during the Arab Spring in particular, has generally failed to show a periphery-inclusive perspective. This article employs statistical data on the use of alternative media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, blogs and YouTube) in Egypt's spring to show how an alternative media structure was expanding which not only empowered social and geographic peripheral actors but was, in turn, also empowered by their contributions. YouTube videos and Twitter messages from peripheral areas exposed police brutality towards protestors in the backstreets that could otherwise have been unnoticed and saved lives in isolated areas in Egypt. Social media thus gained critical mass and expanded to the point that it had an overflow effect from the virtual sphere to the real world. Contrasting the roles of alternative and state-run media machines in different phases of the revolution, the article traces how peripheries could challenge the existing opportunity structure through alternative media, but also how their role has contracted again after the revolution reached its peak.

Yet it has become something of a cliché to maintain that the Free Officers had no blueprint of action before seizing power and that they later instrumentalised pan-Arabism in their foreign policy, thinly veiling their actual commitments to Egyptian nationalism and imperialism. By contrast, this contribution underlines the impact of the British colonial context on the Free Officers' political formation and their early identification with pan-Arabism in turn. Drawing on pamphlets, speeches, media output and memoirs, it shows that the Free Officers developed a distinctive form of anticolonial nationalism that emphasised social justice and invoked overlapping Egyptian and Arab identities. Their aspirations for liberation thus entailed a connected foreign policy and nation building programme in which pan-Arabism was a prime - and early - component.

Arab nationalism and the Arab union of 1958,2015,"The late 1950s was a turbulent period in the history of Arab nationalism. It saw the birth and demise of unity states (the United Arab Republic and the Arab Union), civil war, revolution and Western intervention. Despite its short five-month lifespan, the Iraqi–Jordanian Hashemite Arab Union contributed to the intensification of the traditional Egyptian–Iraqi rivalry, the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958 and the American intervention in Lebanon the same year. It was the result of Arab nationalism, lingering British imperial dreams, the East–West conflict, economic considerations and an inter-Arab cold war. The Arab Union had obvious advantages over the United Arab Republic. Two such advantages were the greater number of cabinet posts granted to Jordan by the Arab Union than were granted to Syria by the United Arab Republic, and the fact that Amman retained its status as capital (one of two union capitals), whereas Damascus was downgraded to the status of provincial capital. These advantages, however, failed to prevent the premature demise of the union, which was caused by a combination of negative domestic and regional perceptions, economic constraint and military commitments.

Popular mobilizations in lebanon: From anti-system to sectarian claims,2015,"In Lebanon, the Arab uprising is often analyzed through the lens of the side effects the Syrian uprising had on the country thanks to the massive refugee influx and involvement of Sunni and Shia Lebanese in Syria’s battleground. In fact, popular mobilizations happened prior to and during the current crisis as two different types of effects of the Arab uprisings at large. First, in late 2010 emerged an anti-sectarian movement that brought up an anti-system claim in line with other Arab social movements targeting authoritarian regimes and corruption. Second, the Sunni radical mobilization that started in Saida in 2011 around the popular Imam Sheikh Assir gathered resentments toward the Shia leading party Hizbullah as involved alongside the Syrian regime and, surprisingly, adopting an active minority mobilization strategy. Both movements conducted demonstrations of different types (from classic marches to on-road sit-ins) starting from a completely opposite perspective and in a very different environment: when the anti-sectarian mobilization faded, the sectarian one rose.

Letters from Tunisia: Darwish and the Palestinian State of Mind,2015,"In this timely and engaged contemplation of the 'Palestinian state of mind', Timothy Brennan takes his cue from a personal experience of the imperviousness of liberal interdisciplinary academia in 'parochial America' towards Arab and Islamic culture. This leads to a longer reflection on the persistent network ofWestern power today, which, having mediated the recent Arab uprisings to its own ends, continues to sustain in myriad forms an oppressive order that cripples the Palestinian effort towards self-determination. In incisive readings of poems by two seminal Palestinian poets, Mahmoud Darwish and Mourid Barghouti, Brennan explores the fraught distance between the sense of 'crushing understatement' in these works: an emotional tenor that is inherently premised both on its readers' will to honour itsmeanings and its embattled operation within, in Brennan's words, 'the disarticulation of a people'. In this light, Brennan's essay moves to address the unintended ironies inherent in the term 'postcolonialist critique' as it encompasses 'the metallic reality of an extravagant contemporary colonialism'. He criticises the complicity of postcolonial studies in exacerbating rather than facilitating 'the difficulty of reading peripheral value', as well as its entrenched reluctance to interrogate imperialism. In the final part of his essay, Brennan advocates attunement to the political address of the aesthetics of the periphery. This as an exercise that, in refusing to rely on the tropes of a compromised literary modernism, seeks to access that 'very physical presence of the bodies of a collectivity in speech' within the literature of the periphery that - like the Palestinian state of mind itself - has been hitherto disparaged by Eurocentric protocols of reading. In the process, and throughout, the paper provides ample reflection on the affinities between the countertextual and critical practice within postcolonial studies. ","Letters from Tunisia: Darwish and the Palestinian State of Mind In this timely and engaged contemplation of the 'Palestinian state of mind', Timothy Brennan takes his cue from a personal experience of the imperviousness of liberal interdisciplinary academia in 'parochial America' towards Arab and Islamic culture. This leads to a longer reflection on the persistent network ofWestern power today, which, having mediated the recent Arab uprisings to its own ends, continues to sustain in myriad forms an oppressive order that cripples the Palestinian effort towards self-determination. In incisive readings of poems by two seminal Palestinian poets, Mahmoud Darwish and Mourid Barghouti, Brennan explores the fraught distance between the sense of 'crushing understatement' in these works: an emotional tenor that is inherently premised both on its readers' will to honour itsmeanings and its embattled operation within, in Brennan's words, 'the disarticulation of a people'. In this light, Brennan's essay moves to address the unintended ironies inherent in the term 'postcolonialist critique' as it encompasses 'the metallic reality of an extravagant contemporary colonialism'. He criticises the complicity of postcolonial studies in exacerbating rather than facilitating 'the difficulty of reading peripheral value', as well as its entrenched reluctance to interrogate imperialism.

Debating Darija: Telquel and language politics in modern Morocco,2015,"This article examines the role of Darija, or Moroccan Arabic, in relation to ongoing debates about Moroccan identity and citizenship in an era of increased global connectivity. In particular, I focus on debates surrounding language and identity in a prominent francophone news magazine called Telquel. Through a thematic textual analysis of Telquel, I examine how language has emerged as a key structuring factor in shaping Moroccan identity and politics. Situated in relation to broader transitions in Moroccan society and culture over the past decade as well as recent socio-political movements across the Middle East–North Africa region, this study shows how Telquel became a crucial site of cultural production wherein discussions of language, identity, and political priorities were played out, particularly in the Arab Spring moment. I argue that Telquel attempts to provoke discussion by constantly testing the boundaries of free expression, taking on taboo topics such as the monarchy, declaring them open for commentary and critique by a new category of citizen-subject.

The spring that has not flowered: what went wrong with the Arab Spring,2015,"It is now more than four years since the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia. The results have been rather disappointing, but the events remain potentially among the grand turns of history. The fruition of the Arab Spring has been impeded by a variety of factors cultural, institutional, political, and historical. And in this mix, there are external and internal factors specific to certain countries. In all the countries involved there were lacunae of institutional infrastructure at the public and civil society levels to govern and participate in governance. The cultural traditions of the Arab world in the wake of the spread of fundamentalist Salafist thinking in recent years, created popular perceptibility for the Islamists, who turned out to be either without programmes and experience or extremists with anti-democratic beliefs and a penchant for terror and violence. In addition, there were beneficiary classes tied to the ancient regimes and soldiers accustomed to domination and privileges, who presented structural impediments to change. Despite the great humanitarian disasters in countries like Syria and Libya, the international community proved incapable of decision and indifferent to the suffering of the populace. Still, the Arab Spring needs time to bring about its aspired transformation and modernization and this might carry with it the type of virtual dynamics we have seen in human history.

Islamism and the state after the Arab uprisings: Between people power and state power,2015,"This paper examines the trajectories of different Islamist trends in the light of the Arab uprisings. It proposes a distinction between statist and non-statist Islamism to help understand the multiplicity of interactions between Islamists and the state, particularly after 2011. It is outlined how statist Islamists (Islamist parties principally) can contribute to the stabilization and democratization of the state when their interactions with other social and political actors facilitate consensus building in national politics. By contrast when these interactions are conflictual, it has a detrimental impact on both the statist Islamists, and the possibility of democratic politics at the national level. Non statist-Islamists (from quietist salafi to armed jihadi) who prioritize the religious community over national politics are directly impacted by the interactions between statist Islamists and the state, and generally tend to benefit from the failure to build a consensus over democratic national politics. Far more than nationally-grounded statist Islamists, non-statist Islamists shape and are shaped by the regional dynamics on the Arab uprisings and the international and transnational relations between the different countries and conflict areas of the Middle East. The Arab uprisings and their aftermath reshaped pre-existing national and international dynamics of confrontation and collaboration between Islamists and the state, and between statist and non-statists Islamists, for better (Tunisia) and for worse (Egypt).

Power and the public sphere: Lessons from tahrir square,2015,"The Arab Spring of 2011 challenged established assumptions about Arab exceptionalism and, to a certain extent, restored our faith in the ability of the public sphere to effect political change. After all, it was thanks to the brave protests of thousands of citizens that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power in February of 2011 But four years after those momentous events, the discursive power of Tahrir Square has been marginalized and limited. Moreover, Egypt’s transition to democracy was de facto suspended by the armed forces in 2013 Using the Egyptian example, this article examines the role of the public sphere in processes of political change.

This law should recognize the right to organize in unions chosen by the workers themselves and the right for those unions to bargain collectively. It should also enforce respect for the right to strike and to engage in other forms of peaceful protest in order to pressure employers to bargain. Workers demanded investment from public and private employers and an active role for themselves in modernizing their industries and services, raising production and improving efficiency, and they argued for the reinstatement of thousands of laidoff employees. Meanwhile, economists working at NGOs, at independent unions and as journalists were proposing a plethora of good ideas for how to rebuild the economy with active citizen participation. These economists were supportive of not only civil and human rights, as defined by the UN Development Program, but also labor rights, including the right to work and to belong to freely chosen labor unions, as defined in international conventions, most of which Egypt had signed onto under Mubarak. Other NGO proposals for Egypt arose out of critiques of World Bank and other IFI-led projects, regarding the negative impact on the built environment and the environmental and social damage inflicted on communities without adequate compensation.","Rebels, reformers and empire alternative economic programs for Egypt and Tunisia Karen Pfeifer describes the alternative economic programs for Egypt and Tunisia, which had suffered the ill effects of neoliberal economic reform, even as the international financial institutions and most economists hailed them as inspiration of progress in the Arab world.

Sectarianism and conflict in Syria,2015,"This article challenges the sectarian narrative of Syria’s current civil war, which relies on several false assumptions about the nature of political identity. It first questions how sectarian the uprising and civil war actually are, suggesting that the conflict is ‘semi-sectarian’, given the multiple other fault lines of contention, notably class, ideology and other non-sect, sub-state ties. It then draws on the theoretical debates between primordialists, ethno-symbolists and modernists to historicise political identity development in Syria. In doing so, it reasserts the modernist case, emphasising how political identities in Syria, both national and sectarian, have developed in a complex interrelated manner in the modern era and how the recent violent mobilisation of sectarian identity is the result of long- and short-term structural, economic, socio-cultural and political factors rather than unchanging ancient animosities. Of these, the most vital remain structural changes and elite reactions to them, with the prospect of state collapse in Syria’s future the most likely cause of a descent into further sectarian chaos.

Post-Arab Spring: changes and challenges,2015,"This paper advances the proposition that post-Arab Spring politics are a product of globalisation’s economic and social liberalisation. The global market and privatisation have fundamentally deconstructed centralised autocratic rule over state and society, while facilitating corruption and selective development, culminating in public outrage. The political order of the Middle East and North Africa since the Arab Spring synthesises globalisation’s dialectic duality, in which economic integration has contributed to the demise of national authoritarianism, inciting communalism and political fragmentation.

"The ""Banksy effect"" and street art in the Middle East",2015,"The English street artist known as Banksy has in recent years become an important figure in the contemporary art world, garnering both critical acclaim and commercial success with his work. The ""Banksy effect"" is a term coined to describe the increased interest in street art that has emerged in the wake of Banksy's popularity. Although the Banksy effect is not universally applauded, it offers a useful lens through which to consider the emergence of street art as a means of popular expression in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This paper considers three places in which street art has been intentionally deployed as a vehicle of political protest or as a means to generate tourism in the face of political unrest: street art in the Palestinian territories; street art in Egypt, particularly Cairo; and the Djerbahood project in Tunisia. A brief discussion of the way in which street art is created and received in each particular area is provided, followed by some observations on how the Banksy effect may be at play in that particular context. The paper concludes that the idea of the Banksy effect has relevance in discussions of street art in the MENA region and that both the positive and negative aspects of the Banksy effect are seen in the region.

Developing democracy through liberal international law,2015,"By deploying the concepts of the international society and the international community this article constructs and defends an explanatory framework that enables us to better understand the complex international political and legal structure of the contemporary world order and better explain why violations of international peace and security occur. The international community describes an association of liberal states that has formed within the politically pluralist international society of sovereign states since the end of the Cold War and which considers only those states that exhibit respect for liberal values as legitimate. Moreover, it argues that the international community has demonstrated a tendency to deny non-liberal states their previously held sovereign right to non-intervention and has instituted a global campaign for their liberal reformation. The existence of the international community is evidenced by reference to the practice of liberal states vis-à-vis non-liberal states since the end of the Cold War and particular attention is paid to the reaction of the international community to the overthrow of the democratic regimes in Honduras and the Ivory Coast and the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Libya and Syria. In light of these developments, this article assesses the impact of the international community upon international law and suggests that international law is being reformulated in order to construct a liberal international law that allows for the effective promotion of liberal values.

Body Image as strategy for engagement in social media,2015,"Worldwide, the use of digital communication networks has been a key strategy in activist events involving demonstrations. Its use was evident in the media's re-peated publication of pictures taken on demonstrators' mobile phones during ac-tions that have overthrown heads of state during the Arab Spring in 2011. In coun-tries such as Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, social network websites and mobile communication devices (phones and notebooks) were used widely for organizing participants and for recording events. This work intends to analyze not only how communication technologies have contributed to the emergence of such events but also how image production can be interpreted in such environments. Since the use of social media in protests caught the attention of broadcasting media in 2009 during demonstrations in Iran, a strong connection can be noticed between the content circulating through digital communication technologies and the body. For images produced during the Arab Spring, the same is observed with a series of strategies connecting body image and social mobilization. Our intention is to contribute to the debate of political images, considering the way they have been produced in contemporary society, which deals with a com-plex environment composed of communication technologies, social organization, and the body itself.","Body Image as strategy for engagement in social media Worldwide, the use of digital communication networks has been a key strategy in activist events involving demonstrations.

Context also matters for democratization, particularly political economic factors, such as a balance of class power and a productive economy; political culture (level of societal identity cleavages) and a minimum of international intervention.

Human Rights as Myth and History: Between the Revolutions of 1989 and the Arab Spring,2015,"Since the end of state socialism in Eastern Europe, the revolutions of 1989 have become a central element in the mythology of human rights. Human rights are portrayed as a catalyst, alighting a revolutionary ethos within those living in the Eastern Bloc. By depicting 1989 as the result of a mass moral epiphany regarding universal human rights, such narratives naturalize and depoliticize the collapse of state socialism. While the discourse of human rights was important in unifying dissident groups, it had also been used to by socialist states to legitimize dictatorial rule. During the Arab Spring, international commentators and local actors invoked this mythological version of 1989 to declare that a similar awakening was once again taking place and that human rights were sure to triumph over dictatorship. The example of Egypt appeared to mirror that of 1989 with mass demonstrations for human rights, prompting optimism that a similar revolutionary change was inevitable. Instead, the successful reassertion of military dictatorship has been legitimized in the name of protecting human rights. In viewing the end of state socialism as the result of the proliferation of human rights consciousness, the mythology of 1989 creates a tragically flawed model for reform and revolution.

The legality of the North Atlantic treaty organization's intervention in Libya,2015,"On 19 March 2011, NATO powers initiated an aerial military campaign in Libya in response to human rights violations associated with the Libyan civil war. For more than seven months, NATO powers and their allies enforced a UN Security Council no-fly zone over Libya by attacking the ground forces of Muammar Gaddafi. The campaign ended on the 31st of October, 2011, in the aftermath of the toppling and death of Gaddafi. This paper analyzes the intervention from an international law perspective. We conclude that despite efforts to expand the parameters established by the United Nations Charter on the use of force, most notably the doctrines of humanitarian intervention and Responsibility to Protect (R2P), prevailing international law does not allow for extra-Charter intervention. Since the relevant Security Council resolutions did not authorize intervention for purposes other than to enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilian populations, the 2011 NATO intervention was not legal. Implications of the NATO intervention in Libya for the further development of the international law of war are also considered.

"Jordan and the ‘Arab Spring’: No Challenge, No Change?",2015,"Many of the factors that in 2011 caused major uprisings in several Arab countries and led to deep political changes were and continue to be present in Jordan. Access to social media, widespread frustration with corruption, high unemployment among the well-educated youth, and growing inequality are but a few of the elements common to Jordan and those Arab states that experienced governmental upheavals. Nevertheless, the Jordanian political reality in the years 2010/11 experienced rather limited demonstrations and modest demands from society that the ruling regime met with traditional practices that the Jordanian monarchy has used to deal with previous, non-revolutionary crisis situations since the 1970s. Although demonstrations in late 2012 were more radical than in 2010/11, they also fell short of creating a revolutionary situation as in Egypt and Tunisia one year earlier. In order to contribute to an explanation of structural particularities in Jordan during the ‘Arab Spring’ we contend that the flow of rent revenues contributes to regime stability. In the case of Jordan, its political rents were significantly higher than those of Egypt and Tunisia, and this situation may help to explain the different outcomes. Political rents contribute both to an explanation of why protests in 2010/11 were less significant and why they could be met by the regime. Yet, rent income as such does not explain political stability fully, and for that reason this article also critically discusses the institutional frame in which the rent streams are embedded.

From Colour Revolutions to the Arab Spring: The Role of Civil Society in Democracy Building and Transition Processes,2015,"After its revival in the 1980s, the concept of civil society has become increasingly linked to the processes of democratization. Colour revolutions and the Arab Spring as recent examples of civic activity have made the idea even more topical, presenting a valuable opportunity for investigating this connection in modern contexts beyond the Western world. This paper looks at the role played by civil societies in the course of revolutions and their aftermath in Ukraine, Georgia, Tunisia and Egypt, assessing their contribution to the democratic transitions of post-Soviet and MENA regions. It does so by looking at civil society as an agent of democracy, in four countries before, during and after the revolutions.

Turkey's fall from grace has been equally as rapid but in a way that has both jeopardised its reputation and dissipated its impact. Though it fleetingly began the 'Arab Spring' to good effect, Turkey's decline since then has been devastating. It was particularly ill prepared to face the most important challenges to its foreign and security policies, namely the devastating conflict within Syria and the unexpected collapse of much of the Iraqi state. More concerned with its great and regional power relations, Turkey was slow to engage with Syria and Iraq in a context of regional turmoil. In spite of its best attempts, stalemate characterises its relations with Asad's Syria. In Iraq, where outcomes are still difficult to predict, Turkey's abandonment of the Syrian Kurds at Kobani has inflicted reputational costs at a global level.","Turkey's foreign policy in the middle east: Swimming out of its depth?

Grounded in a field study of two EU-financed projects in Tunisia, the article discusses the normative understandings of civil society and democracy-building that are being promoted by the EU. It then assesses to what extent these understandings are adhered to on the ground, by the Tunisian actors in charge of implementing the EU-policy. It appears that the EU's enthusiasm for a 'broad', developmental agenda of democracy promotion is waning, as it frames the democratizing role of civil society primarily in a political vein. While the local actors abide by the EU's liberal normativity, they challenge the political framings that condition the European model. In Tunisia, democracy-building is perceived as a bridgehead to prosperity and equitable development. As a result, the local civil society projects privilege socio-economic areas of activity, in a consensus-based and depoliticized framework - in other words, a 'developmental' approach to democracy-building.

How the Arab Spring transformed Turkey's Kurdish issue,2015,"The negotiations with Kurds started before the Arab Spring. Its architects planned and initiated the process before the Arab Spring. However, the balance of power between the government and the Kurdish movement (i.e. the PKK) was dramatically changed during and after the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring linked developments have increased the PKK's (and the Kurds') leverage both domestically and regionally. Contrarily, the Arab Spring weakened Turkey's both material and symbolic capacity. Today, there are three Kurdish cantons in Northern Syria. Therefore, certain results of the Arab Spring linked developments in the region have almost made the realization of the certain targets of the Kurdish opening less likely if not totally impossible.

The article provides an empirical comparison of the cases of Egypt, Tunisia and Syria as points on a continuum of outcomes following the Arab uprising. The article mounts a critique of the absence of class analysis in mainstream transition theory and hypothesises instead an important role for workers’ movements in bringing about even basic elements of liberal democracy. The empirical comparison is shown to support this hypothesis, demonstrating that in Tunisia, the state where the worker's movement was strongest a constitutional settlement has been reached while Syria, the state with the weakest and least independent workers’ movement has descended into counter-revolution and civil war: the case of Egypt lying between these two poles.

On the basis of the data collected, a thematic content analysis has been carried out. Findings – A set of contextual and cultural factors has been highlighted by the analysis. When the context is characterised by poverty, mafia, corruption, or even by a popular revolution or a war in a neighbouring country, these factors may significantly affect new graduates’ decision to create their own firm. Besides, the entrepreneurial decision may be affected by cultural factors: the bureaucratic system, autocracy, and the existence of entrepreneurial milieus such as social class, region, and geographical regions. Research limitations/implications – The inductive qualitative approach adopted in a research study affects the generalisable character of the results. This study is also geographically limited to the great Tunis area (the capital and its suburbs).

The propaganda theory is applied for an analysis of how the media were instrumentalized for political and nationalist goals under Milosevic’s regime. Through content discourse analysis, the techniques of media propaganda are described and analysed, and consequences are drawn. Although the situation varies from one case to another, widespread hate propaganda speeches in some Arab countries is a challenge to a successful political transition. This has been the case in Tunisia after the 2011 Revolution, where hatred messages have been widely spread by broadcast media and social networks. Propaganda theory has thus been applied to the specific case of broadcast television. The study shows that, contrary to some other countries, Tunisian society has its own peculiarities, and that it has succeeded in developing brakes that have reduced the scope and impact of propaganda messages of some extremist media.

In its conclusion, this article also raises the question of social media regulation, which is all the more acute given that Tunisia is immersed in an environment where more and more hate content and stigmatization messages are developing.

New lending arrangements and project initiatives by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, in particular, have emphasised a supposed turn towards pro-poor policies, social inclusion and public engagement with economic decision-making. This article analyses the content and logic of IMF and World Bank lending to these three countries, examining whether this re-engagement represents a substantive shift away from the neoliberal policies that characterised pre-2011 IFI relationships with the region.

Russia and the Arab Spring: Supporting the Counter-Revolution,2015,"Russia’s response to the Arab Spring ranged from apprehension to deep anxiety and diverged significantly from the US and the EU responses. While initially welcoming the popular demands for political reform in North Africa, the Russian reaction rapidly became more critical as a result of Western military intervention into Libya and the threat of the spread of Islamist extremism. It was these twin fears which prompted the Russian leadership to adopt an uncompromizing stance towards Syria. While geopolitical factors certainly played a role in driving Russian strategy, domestic political factors were also more significant. As the Russian leadership felt internally threatened by the growing opposition within the country, conflict in the Middle East highlighted the perceived flaws of the imposition of Western liberal democracy and the virtues of Russia’s own model of state-managed political order. There was, as such, a significant ideational and ideological dimension to the Russian response to the Arab Spring.

Russia's Foreign Policy Towards North Africa in the Wake of the Arab Spring,2015,"Since coming to power in 2000, Russian president Vladimir Putin has tried to construct a narrative of regaining Russia's status as a major global power. However, in practice the Kremlin has yet to create a coherent strategy or achieve a sense of a co-ordinated foreign policy. While North Africa has not been at the forefront of this narrative, recently Moscow has intensified its diplomatic links and cooperation with the regimes in the region. The Arab Spring presented Russian policy makers with a series of challenges regarding the uncertainty of the developments in the region, but also with renewed economic opportunities. This profile analyses Moscow's relationships with the countries in North Africa (Libya, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria) in the wake of the Arab Spring. In each case the Kremlin aimed to take advantage of the new opportunities without really being guided by an overarching strategy for the region. However, Russia increasingly seems to be keen to position itself in the region as an alternative to the EU or the US, not least in light of the current war in Ukraine.

"Enhancing SRTM digital elevation data using anudem algorithm for delineation of drainage pattern in flat terrain: Case study al qweek river, Aleppo, Syria",2015,"The objective of this study is to enhance the quality of the 3 arc-second SRTM v2 elevation model by integrating Ground Control Points (GCPs), Lidar data of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and regional spatial information using the drainage enforcement algorithm (ANUDEM). The algorithm is also used to promote the tracing efficiency of hydrological drainage network in Al Qweek valley. Despite the effect of vegetation and urbanization, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) render detailed three-dimensional replication of the earth surface derived by topographic survey or satellite observations. These models are being used in many applications of geology, geomorphological sciences, hydrogeology, hydrology and natural water resource management in the last decades. Nowadays and after the accelerating technological revolution, ground elevation data at different resolutions are provided for free or by paying Government institutions, research centers, and enterprises. Delineation of hydrological drainage pattern is one of DEMs applications, and it is the key challenge facing researchers in the field of the geographic information system (GIS) and hydrology, particularly in flat terrains. Therefore, high resolution DEMs are usually required to indicate small changes on the terrain surface. Therefore, DEM enhancement is carried out in the study region in the southern part of Aleppo basin, which is characterized by a flat topography and a semi-arid environment. The validity of the enhanced DEM is statistically investigated using different approaches, including histogram and regression analyses, dataset variation, and profile lines statistics considering SRTM90, DLR SRTM30, commercial NEXTmap World30 and the GeoEye-1 high-resolution elevation data. The results show a good convergence between the enhanced DEM and World30 datasets in flat areas of Al Qweek valley, with elevation difference ranges from 1–2 m and an average standard deviation SD= 1.68 m. The calculated residual mean squared error (RMSE) in the enhanced data varies from 0.67 to 2.10 m with respect to topographic and CLAS GCPs, respectively, while RMSE = 1.44 m between the enhanced DEM and the GeoEye-1 elevation model. The results also show significant improvement in tracing performance of the drainage network in the region and reveal the lowest horizontal displacement (0.5–25 m) from the actual drainage lines in comparison with other DEMs. ","Enhancing SRTM digital elevation data using anudem algorithm for delineation of drainage pattern in flat terrain: Case study al qweek river, Aleppo, Syria The objective of this study is to enhance the quality of the 3 arc-second SRTM v2 elevation model by integrating Ground Control Points (GCPs), Lidar data of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and regional spatial information using the drainage enforcement algorithm (ANUDEM).

Among the essential lessons of the 2011 Arab revolutions is that ideological differences and material inequalities do not easily melt, even in emergent, pluralistic, and nondoctrinaire revolutionary politics, because it is difficult to erase positional and embodied differences in the scenes where politics are made.

No more gas from Egypt? Modeling offshore discoveries and import uncertainty of natural gas in Israel,2014,"Israel depends on natural gas imports from Egypt for about 40% of its domestic needs, with the remaining met from domestic production. Gas supplies from Egypt have been erratic since their initiation: disruptions have increased after the 2011 revolution in Egypt and have been further ignited by public discontent. Despite these developments, Israeli policy makers have viewed the Egyptian gas deal as a positive factor in preserving peace with Egypt and have had no better alternatives than relying upon it. This has changed, however, after recent discoveries of three major offshore fields that are expected to satisfy domestic demand for an indefinite period and to provide gas for exports. We use an extended global CGE modeling framework that incorporates multiple households and factor ownership to investigate the effects of reduced gas imports from Egypt and the evolvement of domestic gas production as an alternative. In case of reduced gas imports from Egypt, the Israeli economy would slightly retract mainly due to lower production in energy intensive sectors. Poor households would be the most negatively affected, due to the strongest relative decline in income and the strongest increase of their consumer price index. In the case of increasing domestic gas production, Israeli GDP and domestic absorption would rise by about 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Poor households would be more positively affected than rich ones due to their composition of factor income and their higher expenditure shares for energy intensive commodities.

Palestinian refugees and the Syrian uprising: Filling the protection gap during secondary forced displacement,2014,"Palestinian refugees in the Middle East constitute a protracted refugee situation. In response to political considerations by multiple state actors, they are denied return to their homes of habitual residence and are refused meaningful legal protection in their host countries. Palestinians are therefore suspended between their political objectification in a prolonged conflict on the one hand, and the vulnerability of their humanitarian condition, like all other refugees, on the other. Unlike their refugee counterparts who are persons of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Palestinian refugees endure an uneven legal regime. Since the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP) fell into abeyance, no international agency has searched for durable solutions on behalf of Palestinian refugees, thus exposing them to a protection gap. Instead, the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA), established to furnish Palestinian refugees with aid and relief, has provided them with incremental protection, which, however significant, has been insufficient to close the gap. The extent of this protection gap has been vividly demonstrated during several episodes of secondary forced displacement in the Middle East. In response to their mass expulsion from Kuwait in 1991, Libya in 1996, and Iraq in 2003, UNRWA and UNHCR have closely collaborated in order to bridge this gap and provide Palestinian refugees with adequate protection. These incidents of inter-agency collaboration constitute de facto policies between the two agencies, which demonstrate the flexibility of otherwise rigid delineations between their existing mandates. In particular, past practice makes clear that UNRWA and UNCHR can have overlapping geographic and operational mandates. During the most recent crisis in Syria, these de facto policies have proven inadequate to protect Palestinian refugees. To overcome this challenge, UNHCR and UNRWA should formalize their inter-agency collaboration on behalf of Palestinian refugees during times of calm as well as crisis, in conformity with the spirit of the UNHCR Statute and the 1951 Refugee Convention as well as with past practice. Beyond crisis, the agencies should consider innovative approaches to definitively close the protection gap.

Interactivity in Egyptian newspapers,2015,"The utilisation of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in Egypt has irrevocably changed the nature of the traditional Egyptian public sphere. One can see the Egyptian online society as a multiplicity of networks. These networks have developed, transformed and expanded over time, operating across all areas of life. Nonetheless, in essence they are sociopolitical and cultural in origin. This trend changed the way audiences consumed news, with traditional media – especially independent and opposition – started to utilise ICTs to access online information to develop their media content to escape government control.

The phenomenon of Arab spring in the Middle East,2015,"The term Arab Spring or its Arabic term, al-Rabi’ al-‘Arabi is the revolution of demonstrations and protests of the people against the ruling Government. It was claimed to begin on December 18, 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia. However, this outbreak also spreads to several other Western Asian countries such as Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria. As such, this article aims to analyze the phenomenon of Arab Spring happening in those countries. This article also aims to explore how the outbreak of the unrest occurred and identify the factors that led to the protests of the people as well as to review the role of mass media in the revolution of the people. This study uses a qualitative method which is a document analysis approach to synthesize information from authoritative resources to ensure the validity of the information obtained. The study found that the wave of revolution was the people's protests against the current ruling Government. Several factors such as political, economic, and social factors are the main cause leading to the phenomenon of Arab Spring. Although this may be attributed to issues or problems that vary for each country, the goal of the rise of the people remains the same, i.e. protesting against unfair Government and demanding that people's rights be reinstated.

Reexamining human rights change in Egypt,2015,"Heba Morayef shares her views on the human rights change in Egypt. Throughout the 2000s, the human rights community played a supporting and enabling role in political activism and protest Like any other political organization, human rights groups had to live with heavy surveillance and harassment from the Interior Ministry. This unwanted attention, along with constant smears in the press, meant that no wealthy Egyptian would fund a human rights organization for fear of reprisal against business interests. Human rights groups were therefore completely dependent on foreign funding for survival. The human rights were engaged in a continual tug of war with the regime to push back red lines and open up political space. The 2011 uprising suddenly brought human rights center stage in public discourse, which human rights defenders found themselves with new power to shape. The killing of 846 people over three days in January 2011 meant that public anger focused on calls for accountability, justice for the victims and police reform. The human rights community experienced an unprecedented moment of power in early 2011 In July 2011 the cabinet, under the guidance of International Cooperation Minister Fayza Abu al Naga, set up a fact-finding committee to investigate civil society organizations receiving funding for human rights and democracy promotion.","Reexamining human rights change in Egypt Heba Morayef shares her views on the human rights change in Egypt.

To account for these divergent long-term pathways we systematically compare the 13 current and former Middle East monarchies. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we concentrate on five central explanatory factors derived from previous research – namely, external support, rent revenues, family participation, the monarch's claim to legitimate rule, and hard repression. Our findings highlight the existence of three broad pathways to monarchical survival – linchpin monarchies, like Jordan and Morocco, versus the dynastic Gulf monarchies – and also reveal a possible hybrid third pathway, one which shares linchpin characteristics, but relates to cases on the Arabian Peninsula (Oman and the historical Imamate in North Yemen).

Homsy and Atassi embrace and use Saleh's stature as an iconic figure whose embodied meaning functions as an 'aperture' to a truth beyond his own person; the truth, in this case, about the Syrian revolution. By using theories of iconicity and revolution, the article interrogates current debates about revolution. What can a revolutionary icon do or say in a situation of apparent defeat? What images of revolution can filmmakers create in a state of what Gramsci called the interregnum, when the old is dying and the new is struggling to be born?

It analyzes the film Baladna al-rahib [Our Terrible Country] by Syrian filmmakers Muhammad Ali Atassi and Ziad Homsy as a way to explore current debates about revolution, exile and representation in Syria and the Middle East. Homsy and Atassi embrace and use Saleh's stature as an iconic figure whose embodied meaning functions as an 'aperture' to a truth beyond his own person; the truth, in this case, about the Syrian revolution. By using theories of iconicity and revolution, the article interrogates current debates about revolution. What can a revolutionary icon do or say in a situation of apparent defeat? What images of revolution can filmmakers create in a state of what Gramsci called the interregnum, when the old is dying and the new is struggling to be born?

The Society-Deciders Model and Fairness in Nations,2015,"Modeling the dynamics in nations from economical and sociological perspectives is a central theme in economics and sociology. Accurate models can predict and therefore help all the world's citizens. Yet, recent years have show that the current models are missing. Here, we develop a dynamical society-deciders model that can explain the stability in a nation, based on concepts from dynamics, ecology and socio-econo-physics; a nation has two groups that interconnect, the deciders and the society. We show that a nation is either stable or it collapses. This depends on just two coefficients that we relate with sociological and economical indicators. We define a new socio-economic indicator, fairness. Fairness can measure the stability in a nation and how probable a change favoring the society is. We compute fairness among all the world's nations. Interestingly, in comparison with other indicators, fairness shows that the USA loses its rank among Western democracies, India is the best among the 15 most populated nations, and Egypt, Libya and Tunisia have significantly improved their rankings as a result of recent revolutions, further increasing the probability of additional positive changes. Within the model, long lasting crises are solved rather than with increasing governmental spending or cuts with regulations that reduce the stability of the deciders, namely, increasing fairness, while, for example, shifting wealth in the direction of the people, and therefore increasing further opportunities.

An Exploratory Comparative Study of Recent Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Syrian Arab Republic pre-Arab Spring and Their Health Policy Implications,2014,"Despite the worldwide spread of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and its well-known impacts, it is still a highly neglected disease. The emergence and spread of CL could be affected by a multitude of social, economic, and environmental factors, which could be exacerbated by political instability as the case in the most recent Arab Spring. The present study aimed at studying in a retrospective manner the spatial and temporal characteristics of CL in the years from 1999 to 2010 pre-Arab Spring in two neighboring Middle East countries, namely the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) and Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), in which Arab Spring has emerged with different responses from pro- and anti-governments groups and displacements of refugees occurred. Furthermore, discussion of health policy implications was incorporated in a concluding section. Descriptive non-spatial and spatial statistics analysis, trend surface analysis, clusters mapping analysis, and time-series analysis showed that the risk of CL varied remarkably spatially and temporally in both countries. Overall, the patterns of the disease in Jordan could be described as relatively low and heterogeneous while those in Syria were relatively much higher and less heterogeneous. Moreover, the northwestern parts of Syria formed a relatively hotspot while the southern parts of Syria and northern parts of Jordan formed a relatively cold spot. Also, in both countries the risk of acquiring CL showed general temporal trends of increase although in Syria the trend was much faster than that in Jordan. In addition, it was found that the number of CL cases reported in winter was much higher than those reported in summer in both countries. However, the onset of the Arab Spring might lead to modifications of these patterns through increasing the risk of the disease spatially and temporally and modifying the major forms of the disease as more anthroponotic CL cases might be reported in Jordan and more zoonotic CL cases might be reported in Syria. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing scientifically-based, standardized, and informed national health policies and action plans for combating CL in both countries. As the Syrian crisis is not only affecting Jordan but also other neighboring countries in the Middle East, it is important to study the situation with respect to CL in the whole Middle East pre- and post-Arab Spring and also develop integrated national health policies and action plans for combating the disease in the region.

Corresponding in time to the onset of this regime shift, the climate state transitioned into a combined La Niña and negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which incited a hiatus in global warming in the 2000s. Superimposed upon a long-term regional drying trend, synergistic interactions between these teleconnection modes triggered the establishment of a devastating and prolonged drought, which engulfed the Fertile Crescent, namely, Iraq and Syria, and led to crop failure and civil unrest. Dried soils and diminished vegetation cover in the Fertile Crescent, as evident through remotely sensed enhanced vegetation indices, supported greater dust generation and transport to the Arabian Peninsula in 2007–2013, as identified both in increased dust days observed at weather stations and enhanced remotely sensed aerosol optical depth. According to backward trajectory analysis of dust days on the Arabian Peninsula, increased dust lifting and atmospheric dust concentration in the Fertile Crescent during this recent, prolonged drought episode supported a greater frequency of dust events across the peninsula with associated northerly trajectories and led to the dust regime shift.

Mubarak’s fall in egypt: How and why did it happen?,2015,"After nearly 30 years in power, the Hosni Mubarak regime in Egypt, considered by many to be the strongest in the Arab world, collapsed suddenly in February 2011 after a mere 18 days of street protests. In this article, we try to explain the puzzling collapse of the Mubarak regime using regime transition theory. We argue that the Mubarak regime’s collapse came about as a result of four key developments, none of which were sufficient to cause the regime’s collapse, but when coalesced together exposed the regime’s lack of coercive and persuasive powers, thereby hastening its demise. We conclude that regime transition theory, developed to explain the third wave of democratisations in the 1970s and 1980s, is still relevant in explaining transitions from authoritarian rule.

This paper analyzes the city as both the site and stake of political contestation between state and society in Kuwait, and the relationship between contentious politics and city formation after the advent of oil.

Does Coup-Proofing Work?

Syria's Forgotten First President Mohammad Ali al-Abed,2014,"The story of Syria's first president Mohammad Ali al-Abed is not told in Syrian history books, for a variety of reasons. One is the drama of Syrian history after 1936, when he stepped down. Another is the fact that he came to power with French blessing, making him an easy target for the National Bloc, which dominated Syrian public life from 1936 until 1958. When the Ba'athists came to power in 1963, they systematically excised entire sections of modern Syrian history; anything that came before the socialist revolution, they claimed, was capitalistic, imperialistic, elitist, backward, and ultimately wrong. Any praise of Abed, or his generation of Syrian nationalists, tended to result in harassment by the security services, or jail. As a result, four generations grew up in Ba'athist Syria knowing of no other president than Hafez al-Assad. This article tries to remedy this by shedding light on the career of a forgotten president from pre-Baath Syria. ","Syria's Forgotten First President Mohammad Ali al-Abed The story of Syria's first president Mohammad Ali al-Abed is not told in Syrian history books, for a variety of reasons. One is the drama of Syrian history after 1936, when he stepped down. Another is the fact that he came to power with French blessing, making him an easy target for the National Bloc, which dominated Syrian public life from 1936 until 1958. When the Ba'athists came to power in 1963, they systematically excised entire sections of modern Syrian history; anything that came before the socialist revolution, they claimed, was capitalistic, imperialistic, elitist, backward, and ultimately wrong. Any praise of Abed, or his generation of Syrian nationalists, tended to result in harassment by the security services, or jail. As a result, four generations grew up in Ba'athist Syria knowing of no other president than Hafez al-Assad.

The Omani Pursuit of a Large Peninsula Shield Force: A Case Study of a Small State's Search for Security,2014,"After the failure of a small Peninsula Shield Force (PSF) to protect Kuwait in the lead up to the Gulf War in 1991, Sultan Qaboos, the ruler of Oman, proposed to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) that it develop a large-standing army of 100,000 troops. Although Oman was not wholly successful in achieving its objective during the main negotiation period up to 1995, it did manage to contribute to small shifts in GCC security policy during periods of conflict. Nevertheless, it took the Arab Uprisings in 2011 to achieve a fundamental re-orientation of GCC security policy which favoured higher numbers of PSF troops. This paper analyses the factors which facilitated and constrained Omani policy during the 20-year period and argues that Oman is only able to further its security interests when they are framed in a way that are conducive to the overriding political interests of the GCC.

Protecting a moveable and immoveable feast: Legal safeguards for Yemen's cultural heritage,2014,"This paper surveys the current imperfect legal protections afforded to Yemen's immense cultural heritage. It focuses on recent positive legislative developments, including a new law to protect historic cities, while highlighting ongoing challenges, especially smuggling. Legal efforts to protect heritage are a requirement for retaining Zabid on the UNESCO List of World Heritage and are also crucial to continued conservation of the Old City of Sana'a. Political changes resulting from Yemen's Arab Spring have recently drawn attention to these and other heritage issues. The paper argues that the political, economic, and security crises necessitate particular and urgent attention to protection of cultural heritage in the country, including a strong legal regime to encourage positive activity and to combat the neglect and criminality that presently threaten conservation.

It centers not on the oft-studied subject of women and the regulation of femininity in Arab countries, but on the complex relationship between masculinity and performance, highlighting the sociocultural norms that have shaped and affected the performance of masculinity in Arabo-Muslim contexts. In particular, this study examines how Tahiri uses subversive comedy to challenge traditional views and constructions of male and female roles, to expose and dismantle the normative constructions of masculinity, and to promote the emergence of a new social frame that begs for different gender performances.

Arab Spring, which started in Tunisia in 2010 and quickly spread to several countries of the Middle East and North Africa, also significantly shaped the various decisions of the PKK, as well as Turkey’s policies to resolve the Kurdish Question in recent years. This paper examines how the Arab Spring has influenced domestic and regional dynamics of the PKK and the Kurdish Question within the framework of the PKK’s decision making processes.

Syrian sport on an international stage: Evaluating the sports movement between 1970 and 2013,2014,"Although Syria did not compete in Olympic Games between 1948 and 1970, its participation in most sport mega-events has been varied in terms of the level of participation, results, different championships and sports mega-events types since 1970. The nature of Syria’s involvement in sport on the international stage reflects the nature of the institutional-culture context after the ‘Corrective Movement’ led by the late President Hafez al-Assad. This article relies on the official archive of the General Sport Federation in Syria, official International Olympic Committee publications and other material to examine the history of Syria’s competitions and its results in different sports events. It is argued that Syrian competition in most regional/international games has not only been because of the social/political support represented by the Baath party but also it has been a means of reflecting the civilised and secular face of Syria and Syrians after a long period of coups in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper concludes by contending that political stability between 1970 and 2011 helped the sports movement to flourish. Even political conflicts after 2011 did not influence the desire for competition, but it was noted that the lack of security, and the increasing terrorism and political/ economic sanctions, were the major barriers to Syrian sport on an international stage after the ‘Arab Spring’, which had a negative impact on the support of most sports teams and missions.

The article identifies the tensions in Kuwait's political system resulting from the steady rise in the bar of political opposition over the past decade as well as mounting imbalances within both the ruling family and the political opposition. As boundaries of permissible activity have been tested and exceeded, neither the al-Sabah nor the established political groups have known how to respond, making Kuwait politics at once dynamic, fluid, and relentlessly unstable.

In identifying three critical areas in which civic media and non-governmental organisations are translating social programmes to strengthen concepts of citizenship through cooperative action – information provision, advocacy and education – this study argues that they are contributing to the development of a strong new media space in the form of citizen radios. These, often web-based broadcasters provide opportunities, particularly for youth in both provincial and urban areas, to develop capacities as producers, consumers and story subjects, offering them new tools to experiment with blogging, citizen journalism, social messaging and identity building. The partnership of these two sectors provides significant benefits in terms of funding provision, democracy promotion and capacity building, although, it is argued, they can also place limits on the independence and future growth of these citizen radio platforms. The message, financing and regulation of this growing field of civil society/citizen radio output remains at the centre of a continuous negotiation of powers shifting to the public sphere.

Managing the Arab Spring: The Saudi Way,2014,"The Arab Spring posed a number of challenges for Saudi Arabia both internally and externally. Its primary concern was to maintain security and stability within the kingdom as it feared a spillover of the problems faced by the affected countries. Arab Spring also challenged the regional dynamics which had the potential to harm Saudi national interests. Thus, the monarchy tried to manage the emerging situation by keeping an eye on its domestic stability and maintaining its external standing. Though it applied similar strategies inside and outside, the approaches were contradictory. It was accommodative in dealing with the situation within, but chose to be assertive when it came to pursuing its interests outside. It managed to effectively achieve its objectives of avoiding the spread of protests and the attendant potential for instability inside the kingdom despite facing security concerns. Moreover, it was largely successful in influencing the events in Bahrain and Yemen to secure its interests, and with Syria staring at a stalemate and an altered situation in Egypt, the potential threat of a radically changed regional environment also subsided. Thus, the Saudi aims of protecting the national interests and keeping the regional dynamics intact while ensuring the security and stability of the kingdom were fulfilled. However, with the evolving nature of sociopolitical life in the Arab world in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, the monarchy needs to develop a nuanced and sustainable approach toward dealing with these recurring issues.

To explore the role played by Arab identity politics in regionalism with regard to the status of non-Arab states, this article presents a study of the competing hegemonic regional discourses employed by Turkey, Iran and Egypt during a two-year period following the 2011 uprising in Egypt. This analysis suggests that even during a time of crisis, non-Arab states face obstacles to their assertion of regional projects and that Arabness is a central factor in the narratives resisting alternative interpretations of the interests and definition of the Middle East as a region. The article concludes that Arabness forms the hegemonic discourse that shapes the international relations of the Middle East.

Perceptions of the Turkish Model in Post-Revolutionary Tunisia,2014,"The most significant gap within the current discourse of Turkish model and democratization in post-revolutionary Middle East and North Africa region is that limited works have attempted to approach the concept from the perspective of local actors in the region. This study analyzes the perception of the Turkish model by using data acquired through interviews with policy-makers and influential actors in Tunisian society. It will be shown that the ideological division of Tunisian society into two camps, secularists and Islamists, has shaped the perceptions of the Turkish model in the country. It will be argued that despite their differences, the model can appeal to both secularists and conservatives in terms of its post-ideological nature that endorses the concept of “civil state” which is supported by both political groups.

"Disengagement from politics: Nationalism, political identity, and the everyday in a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan",2014,"In al-Wihdat, a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, there is today a puzzling absence of political participation among camp dwellers. This absence is all the more striking for a number of reasons. First of all, because Palestinian refugee camps in the Middle East are widely held to be bastions of political resistance and Palestinian nationalism. Secondly, because this lack of political participation coincides with the outbreak of unprecedented turmoil in the Arab world. Is refugees’ disengagement from politics a clear sign of their passive assimilation or, conversely, a form of political protest tout court? What forms does Palestinian nationalism take in a country that has granted full citizenship rights to the majority of refugees? More generally, how do claims of national belonging articulate with other, apparently conflicting, national identities? Taking as its starting point the reverberations of the “Arab Spring” in Jordan, this paper wants to shed light on the complexities associated with refugees’ socioeconomic and political integration in Jordan. More broadly, it aims to add to a scholarly debate that has recently urged anthropologists and social scientists to rethink the categories of “the political” and “political agency.” What will be argued here is that refugees’ eagerness to distance themselves from what they saw as the dangerous world of politics can also be explained with Carl Schmitt’s specific understanding of the political. According to the philosopher, the distinction between friend and enemy lies at the very core of “the political.” In Jordan, this distinction is played out in the seemingly contradiction of being both Palestinian refugees and Jordanian citizens. However, if politics requires taking a firm stand either as Palestinian refugees or Jordanian citizens that camp dwellers are unwilling to take, a descent into what refugee perceives as a nonpolitical ordinariness enables them to negotiate the complexities of their lives.

Year Four: The arab spring proved everyone wrong,2014,"Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa are experiencing wrenching change, but unlike in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, each affected country is moving in different and sometimes opposing directions. Each has its own history, its own narrative.

From the very beginning, Tunisia's liberal and secular opposition resisted Ennahda so effectively that the Islamists had to abandon their push for a religious state and grudgingly accept a secular civil state. Sisi's regime reeks of Stalinism these days. In March of this year, more than five hundred Muslim Brotherhood officials were sentenced to death in one swoop. Many of those sentences were commuted to life, but the regime did it again the very next day and sentenced six hundred more.","Year Four: The arab spring proved everyone wrong Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa are experiencing wrenching change, but unlike in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, each affected country is moving in different and sometimes opposing directions.

"Durable, Yet Different: Monarchies in the Arab Spring",2014,"Over three years into the Arab Spring, the Middle East is characterized by a striking difference in durability between monarchies and republics. Beyond this difference, some significant gaps within the group of the eight Middle East monarchies have so far been overlooked. Drawing on the existing monarchy research, we first make the case that there were three distinct types of durable monarchies prior to the Arab Spring. Confronted with social and political crises, each type reacted differently to the challenges presented to them after 2011. While five “rentier” and “dynastic” Gulf monarchies (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates)) mainly rely on material distribution and family rule, the non-oil “linchpins” of Jordan and Morocco, attracting additional external funds, undertook constitutional changes in an attempt at procedural legitimation. The Sultanate of Oman, however, falls in between. This “linchtier” monarchy used modest material cooptation, a selected personal reshuffling at the top of the regime as well as targeted institutional adaptations. We illustrate our findings with similarly structured brief case studies of the three prototypes of Qatar, Jordan and Oman.

This case study examines how the Salafist current uses the Internet to challenge the narrative and mobilise on the ground. It goes even further to access how the ideology itself serves these ends. This article also finds that Islamist activists' online contestation depends on the extent to which their ideology accepts, tolerates and navigates Tunisia's ever present secular political system.

We try to predict the length of the Syrian insurgency with a three-stage technique.

After determining the model with the highest predictive power, we categorize Syria according to the variables in this final model. Based on in-sample approaches, we then predict the duration of the Syrian uprising for three different scenarios. The most realistic point prediction is 5.12 years from the insurgency’s start, which suggests an end date between the end of 2016 and early 2017.

‘England is fighting us everywhere’: geopolitics and conspiracy thinking in wartime Morocco,2014,"This article examines allegations that the ‘Intelligence Service’ of Great Britain exploited nationalist movements in the region to ensure the future British domination of North Africa. In some ways this was a classic conspiracy theory with its vision of an omniscient organisation secretly controlling global events. Yet documents in the UK's National Archives reveal that during the Second World War, British agents did indeed provide covert support to Moroccan nationalism, including in particular the Party of Moroccan Unity under Mekki al-Naciri (1906–94). Furthermore, acting in concert with the US Office of Strategic Services, British intelligence prepared for a full-scale uprising in northern Morocco. Although British covert action was halted in 1944–45, its political ramifications, combined with pre-existing fears of British duplicity, explain much of Morocco's suspicion surrounding British intentions during the years leading up to Moroccan independence in 1956. The article concludes that while the belief in an external conspiracy was a paradigm in Moroccan history during the colonial period, on occasion the Great Powers and their agents did in fact plan covert actions in pursuit of their interest in controlling the North African littoral.

The Arab Spring and the Italian Response to Migration in 2011: Beyond the Emergency,2014,"This paper seeks to unpack and explain the relationship between the emergency rhetoric used by Italian politicians and the policies implemented in Italy in response to the influx of irregular migrants from North Africa during 2011. It analyses how the language relates to the policies adopted and considers the impact on relations between Italy and the European Union (EU) in the area of migration. Accordingly, I address two main questions. How can we understand the emergency lexicon in relation to the policies adopted by Italy in response to irregular arrivals from North Africa in 2011? Secondly, what are the implications for EU-Italian engagement? In other words, how has the vehement and popularized emergency-centred debate in Italy affected interaction between Italy and the EU? To tackle these questions, the analysis is divided into five sections. The first section introduces the academic discussion on migration in Italy and focuses on three themes central to this paper: emergency, ambiguities in migration policies, and the EU as vincolo esterno (external constraint). The second section illustrates briefly the methodology employed and explains the selection of the case-study. Thirdly, I outline and examine the policies implemented by Italy between January and December 2011 and investigate the shifting language along the crisis-normality continuum. The fourth section turns to the international level and chronicles the relations between Italy and the European Union concerning irregular arrivals from North Africa. With regard to the latter, attention is given to the implications of the agreement between Tunisia and Italy. The domestic and international strands are brought together in the fifth section, which probes the reliance on discourses of emergency in the way that migration and asylum policies are presented vis-à-vis the European Union. Fear, I argue, remains a key factor in the shaping of ideas and policies across both the domestic and international domains. However, not all the policies adopted can be ascribed to the logic of fear alone, and indeed some actually run counter to the emergency rationale that shapes the wider political debate.

The Arab Spring: A simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution,2014,"We introduce a simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution in dictatorial regimes that employ censorship and police repression. A defining property of the model is the use of visibility and policing terms that feature rapid transitions as a function of the size of the revolution, for which we provide conceptual and network-based mathematical justifications. The complete mathematical classification of the dynamical behaviour of the model leads to a division in parameter space that is interpreted naturally in terms of stability of the regime (stable police state, meta-stable police state, unstable police state, and failed state). We show that these dynamical properties of the model are generic for a broad class of visibility and policing functions that feature rapid transitions. We investigate how the model can be applied to the peaceful revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, taking into account the influence of the Internet and new media on the visibility of the revolution and the ensuing reduced effectivity of censorship.

These properties of the model inform possible answers to questions on causes and timing of the Arab Spring revolutions, and the role of the Internet and new media. The broader relevance of the model classification is also investigated by applying it to the current political situation in some other countries with regimes that employ censorship and police repression. ","The Arab Spring: A simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution We introduce a simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution in dictatorial regimes that employ censorship and police repression. A defining property of the model is the use of visibility and policing terms that feature rapid transitions as a function of the size of the revolution, for which we provide conceptual and network-based mathematical justifications. The complete mathematical classification of the dynamical behaviour of the model leads to a division in parameter space that is interpreted naturally in terms of stability of the regime (stable police state, meta-stable police state, unstable police state, and failed state). We show that these dynamical properties of the model are generic for a broad class of visibility and policing functions that feature rapid transitions. We investigate how the model can be applied to the peaceful revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, taking into account the influence of the Internet and new media on the visibility of the revolution and the ensuing reduced effectivity of censorship. Within the model this leads to significant, discontinuous changes in regime stability, which greatly increase the probability of realized revolutions.

Online Media and Offline Empowerment in Post-Rebellion Tunisia: An Analysis of Internet Use During Democratic Transition,2014,"Social media are reputed to have played a crucial role in mobilizing citizens against autocratic governments in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region. In Tunisia, digital activists successfully used social media to organize the popular protests that ousted President Ben Ali in January 2011. However, the phase of mobilizing protest to overthrow an established authority is different from constructing a political order to replace that authority. Hence the question arises: In what ways can social media contribute to democratic transitions beyond popular rebellion? This article focuses on the attitudinal factors that lie at the heart of cultural-behavioral approaches to democratization. A key element in the democratic consolidation of post-autocratic societies is the development of a participatory political culture, which, among other factors, depends on citizens' perceived political efficacy. Using data obtained from a Web survey among 610 Tunisian Internet users, we test the degree to which respondents' political use of the Internet during the Tunisian uprising influenced their levels of internal political efficacy and whether this shift in attitudes is positively related to measurable changes in electoral participation from authoritarian to post-authoritarian rule.

Democracy and Islamist Violence: Lessons from Post-Mubarak Egypt,2014,"This article explores the contentious relation between the absence of democracy in the Middle East and the use of armed violence by Islamist groups in light of the Arab Spring. Its main objective is to decipher the evolving positions of former and current groups who used or promoted violence and to relate them to broader academic debates on violence and democracy on the one hand, and deradicalization on the other. This research demonstrates that the large majority of former Islamist militants in Egypt reject any sort of violence in post-Mubarak Egypt, even if they have not all renounced their religious legitimization of violence in the past. Second, it reveals that even if they maintain a religious opposition to democracy in Egypt, the opening of political opportunities and their progressive joining of the political process has favorably led most of them to accept democratic practices in reality. Third, it adds that the voice of those currently promoting violence in Egypt has been marginalized and that their main alternative has been the promotion of armed violence in Syria; and last, it stresses two potential security threats unrelated to the opening of political opportunities in post-Mubarak Egypt and to the general debate on democracy and violence. First, local grievances in Sinai have led to violence in the past and are still to be dealt with. Second, the current political deadlock can potentially lead to localized and specific armed activities that could start a cycle of violence. This research is based on field research in Egypt and uses repeated interviews of leaders and members of the two main former militant groups, al-Jama῾ah al-Islamiyya (the Islamic Group) and Jama῾ al-Jihad (the Jihad Group) as well as interviews with militants of the salafi jihadi trend and their supporters in Cairo.

Sufficient condition is then the presence of strong regional states with ideological appeal and material resources so as to build the first momentum towards a communal sense of security. This paper argues that the Arab Spring mostly met the first condition. The communal waves, at least briefly, united Arab people divided across the borders of multitude of states.

This study therefore identifies repression's variegated forms and movements' corresponding responses using fifty-seven interviews with reform-oriented activists in Jordan, a ""liberalized"" authoritarian state, obtained in 2011. The findings demonstrate that activists (1) transformed softer repression into valued opportunities for communication with officials, and (2) responded to harder forms by publicizing repression through protests and their alliance networks, which persuaded the image-conscious regime to temper its tactics and prompted both sides to return to bargaining. This dynamic exemplifies a process of contained escalation, which helps to explain why Jordan's Arab Spring remained nonrevolutionary.

Nevertheless, the Security Council consistently failed to act during the course of Arab uprisings due to a number of structural and procedural problems, including the primacy of national interests, permanent members' disagreement about the meaning of 'collective security,' and the isolated nature of decision-making whereby the substance of major resolutions is negotiated behind closed doors.","Roaring in Libya, whispering in others: UN Security Council's posture during the 'Arab Spring' This paper examines the position of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) during the Arab revolutions of 2010-2013.

The Arab Spring and the Notion of External State Sovereignty in International Law,2014,"The notion of external sovereignty is not one that is free from contestation. Yet, it is defined in this article broadly as a state's independence and exclusive authority over its territory and those residing upon it. The events of the Arab Spring have challenged this form of sovereignty with human rights and humanitarian law violations being discussed in various quarters. This article discusses the notion of external state sovereignty in light of these events. It dissects the notion into various relevant constituent elements of sovereign equality, protection from intervention, and the protection from the use of force and discusses how they can be discerned in the midst of the conflicts in the Arab Spring, in particular those in Libya and Syria. However, it also assesses how the events of these conflicts have impacted upon these various elements of the notion. In this respect, while it portrays external sovereignty as an enduring concept, aspects of it have been questioned and its contours have been challenged during the course of the Arab Spring. More specifically the emergence of the Responsibility to Protect concept has influenced the way in which various forms of intervention have been undertaken and judged by the international community.

The use of information and communication technologies in three Egyptian newsrooms,2014,"The basis of the information revolution in Egypt centres on the use and appropriation of technological advancements. At its forefront is the growth of information and communication technologies (ICTs), which offer an active and interactive platform for socio-political development, including the circumstances leading to the “25 January 2011 revolution”, predominantly labelled as the “Facebook” or Twitter revolution’. After this “digital” revolution many Egyptians continued using cyberspace. They clustered in networks, created parallel communication systems, each with its own identity, and interacted on issues of common concern. Witnessing a changing environment, the Egyptian journalism industry has had no choice but to overcome its fear of adopting technologies in order to fit into the new mould. Several newsrooms have adopted ICTs in the hope that the new media would help them to develop their content and reconnect with their audiences. Although on the surface this implies development, this claim requires further assessment. This study therefore aims to investigate the implementation and appropriation of ICTs, especially internet technologies, in three Egyptian newsrooms: Al Ahram, Al Dostor, and Al Masry Al Youm. The study further examines the extent to which newsrooms are incorporating ICTs into their daily routine as well as how the technologies are shaping and redefining practices.

"Egyptian journalistic professionalism in the context of revolution: Comparing survey results from before and after the January 25, 2011 uprising",2014,"This study presents the results of two comparative surveys of Egyptian print journalists carried out in late 2008 and June 2013, respectively. The surveys aimed to assess aspects of Egyptian print journalism practice and professionalism at two different points in time: during the late Hosni Mubarak era and during Mohammed Morsi's one-year term in office. The surveys addressed journalism education and training quality, work routines, perceptions of press freedom, and journalistic ideology. Results offer insights into the inner workings of Egyptian journalism before and after the 2011 revolution that ousted Mubarak and, importantly, a baseline on which to gauge Egypt's future progress on key measures of journalistic professionalism.

African solutions to African problems: The necessity of African Union's intervention in the crisis of democratic institutionalization in post-arab spring Egypt,2014,"This paper examines the imperative of African Union's intervention in the crisis of democratic institutionalization in Egypt. It utilized secondary sources of data in the analysis and interpretation of the current situation in Egypt. Findings show that the current crisis in Egypt and the increasing violence indicate that governance by force and through the exclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood will escalate the crisis and will be very risky for the stability of Egypt and the region. Consequently, the paper calls on the African Union to provide the strategic leadership and the good offices in resolving the crisis. The paper suggests that in doing this, the AU should ensure that the process is founded on unambiguous, predictable conditions and strong institutions supported by popular participation.

"Contextualizing the power of social media: Technology, communication and the Libya Crisis",2014,"At the beginning of 2011, revolution across the MENA region threw into question the potential power of new media to bring about large-scale revolutionary pursuits. In Libya, the correlation between social media usage and social upheavals seemed, at most, tenuous in light of low levels of Internet penetration generally and in light of the state-sponsored Internet blackout following the nation-wide protests there. This qualitative research intends, through content analysis and semi-structured interviewing of key communicators, to decode the realities of how and why people were communicating through the crisis in Libya from its inception and to overcome misconceptions about social media as a stand alone or predominant factor in liberation across the region. What emerged from this case study was a confluence of actions and tools responsible for communication through the crisis, of which social media featured significantly. This paper will further discuss the significance of the convivial relationships of the Internet-based campaigners working towards a 'democratic' outcome in Libya and working beyond the limitations of national Internet connectedness. I conclude that there is a great potential for Internet-based networks to support widespread social upheaval within ripe socio-political settings.

SYRIA: HOPE OR DESPAIR?,2014,"From independence, Syria evolved somewhat differently from other Arab states. When Hafez al-Assad took over, internally he favoured a very Soviet-style centralisation of power and in the eyes of the West his foreign policy made Syria a “pariah” state. When his son Bashar succeeded him, there were hints of an open-ness to new political and economic thinking. European powers started to thicken up their relationship. The US/UK invasion of Iraq put an end to that. The Old Guard regained the ground they had lost. At least on the surface, the economic situation seemed manageable, though agricultural livelihoods were deteriorating sharply. Enter the Arab Spring. The regime's response was brutal and widely condemned, but in an international context very different from that of other threatened Arab regimes. Syria is a major Russian client and an ally of Iran. Nor were there easy choices for the West. The initially-moderate opposition splintered, with Islamist forces increasingly prominent. If there is a slender hope for the future it lies in building on the recent US/Russian diplomatic cooperation over the dismantling of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. The improved atmosphere in the talks over the Iran nuclear issue could also be a possible ray of sunlight. But the present situation is grim: casualties are mounting and the immense refugee problem needs more attention from the West. ","SYRIA: HOPE OR DESPAIR?

The Base that Replaced the British Empire: De-Democratization and the American Navy in Bahrain,2014,"This article analyzes the emergence and undermining of the first democratic experiment in Bahrain, which took place during the transition from British to American hegemony over the Persian Gulf. Shortly after achieving independence, Bahrain witnessed a democratic breakthrough in 1973, as the first parliament began to challenge the authority of the ruling family in key areas such as the national budget, internal security, and its foreign relations. It also wanted to terminate the American naval presence, which it saw as a relic of the colonial era. With the last British troops having been withdrawn in 1972, the US Navy was given an official eviction notice in 1973, and again in 1975. Congressional opinion in the USA also favored withdrawal. Confronted with opposition from both the Bahraini and US legislatures, US defense officials strived to differentiate the American presence from the previous British colonial presence by arguing that the US navy base did not imply a commitment to defend Bahrain but was merely a show-the-flag operation, was not involved in the domestic politics of the island, and was not a permanent presence but could be annulled by either side. In 1975, the Amir dissolved the parliament; it was not reinstated until 2002. I demonstrate through the use of recently declassified documents that US officials gave precedence to maintaining basing access over supporting the parliament, and hence were complicit in the de-democratization of Bahrain.

Being a neighbor to Syria: A retrospective analysis of patients brought to our clinic for cranial gunshot wounds in the Syrian civil war,2014,"Objective Toward the end of 2010, the Arab spring, the waves of revolutionary demonstrations and protests influenced also Syria, where violent clashes turned into a civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people became refugees. The use of excessive force unfortunately culminated in numerous deaths and injuries in many cities. Being the closest city to Aleppo, Damascus and Homs, the biggest cities of Syria, Antioch/Hatay has been the city where initial emergency treatments were performed. For this reason, we examined and retrospectively analyzed the medical records of the patients treated in the clinics of our hospital due to cranial gunshot wounds during the war. Material and methods The medical records of 186 patients who were injured in the Syrian War and brought to, followed up and treated in the Neurosurgery Clinic of Mustafa Kemal University, Faculty of Medicine in Hatay, a Turkish city on the Syrian border, between April 2011 and June 2013. Results A total of 186 patients were evaluated in a period of more than 2 years. Of all 91.4% of the patients were adults (male/female: 152/18) and 8.6% of them were pediatric patients (male/female: 14/2). The average age of the patients was 31 years, with an age range of between 2 months and 67 years. According to Glasgow coma score (GCS) of the patients at the time of admission, GCS was 3 in 32 patients (17.2%), between 4 and 7 in 70 patients (37.6%), and between 8 and 15 in 84 patients (45.1%). We observed that the patients with GCS of 4-7 had a significantly lower mortality among the 56 patients treated surgically compared with the 14 patients treated medically. Discussion Cranial gunshot wounds are responsible for high mortality and morbidity. A multiplicity of factors plays a role on morbidity and mortality. These are the duration of transport, the injury pattern, the velocities of the weapons used, and the Glasgow Coma Scales of the patients at the time of admission. Conclusion The authors recommend that the patients with cranial gunshot wounds who has GCS of 4-7 should be aggressively treated including surgery as well. We do not recommend surgical treatment for patients with GCS of 3. All our experiences show that treatment of gunshot wounds will continue to be a matter of debate, about which there is more to learn. The data presented in this study will once again demonstrate the seriousness of the event, and will, perhaps, contribute to the peace negotiations to end the war.

We do not recommend surgical treatment for patients with GCS of 3. All our experiences show that treatment of gunshot wounds will continue to be a matter of debate, about which there is more to learn. The data presented in this study will once again demonstrate the seriousness of the event, and will, perhaps, contribute to the peace negotiations to end the war. ",['syr'],CW,False,True,False,2
Embassies burning: toward a near-real-time assessment of social media using geo-temporal dynamic network analytics,2014,"Effective crisis response requires rapid assessment of a situation in order to form actionable plans. Social media and traditional media are critical to this assessment. This paper describes a rapid ethnographic approach for extracting information from Twitter and news media and then assessing that information using dynamic network analysis techniques. Text mining high-dimensional network analytics and visualization are combined to provide an integrated approach to assessing large dynamic networks. This approach was used as the Benghazi consulate and the Egyptian embassy were attacked in 2012. This near-real-time assessment was set against a backdrop of ongoing data collection associated with the Arab Spring countries. This ongoing collection provided a baseline for Libya and Egypt against which the new data could be assessed. Herein, the outcome of that near-real-time assessment, the tools used, the lessons learned, and the results discovered are described. The same approach was used in other crisis events including SuperStorm Sandy, the Kenyan elections, from which examples are also drawn. We find that to be effective such analytics require the use of multiple media, deep dives into specific secondary issues, and a high-level assessment of not just who is doing what, but who is providing what information. Finally, we show the criticality of baseline data for interpreting the behavior during a crisis.

Russian-Syrian Dialogue: Myths and Realities,2014,"Since the very beginning of the “Arab Spring,” analysts have been arguing about its implications for the Middle East. Indeed, its outbreak in 2011 was probably one of the most important events to have ever taken place in the region, completely transforming its sociopolitical structure and reshaping the configuration of its international relations. Moreover, beyond their regional importance, the revolutionary processes of the Arab Spring have had significant international implications that have affected the actions of countries far beyond the borders of the Middle East. Russia has not been an exception: the regional processes forced Moscow to revise its attitude toward the Middle East, literally dragging the Russian authorities into the shifting currents. Moscow believes that the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power would trigger the expansion of jihadist activity and increase instability in the Caucasus and southern Russia. Consequently, the Kremlin is deeply concerned about the rise of Islamism in the Middle East, as well as Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s efforts to support Islamist and, indeed, radical factions in the Syrian civil conflict. At the same time, the absence of an obvious ideological basis for current Russian-Syrian relations leaves them open to change. Thus, official guarantees that the jihadists will not export their revolution elsewhere, accompanied by promises to preserve certain Russian economic positions in post-Assad Syria, could possibly clear the way for the emergence of a compromise stance by Moscow on Syria, even on the presently contentious issue of foreign intervention.

It pits the growing large community of Islamic-committed citizens (just under 60 percent in Egypt according to Pew Center surveys) and frustrated youth wanting participatory governance and legitimate freedoms against military autocrats, their business and judicial associates, and hereditary rulers in the region who wish to maintain the status quo against the bedrock Islamic principle of representative governance. Tunisia leads the way in providing a to-date successful transition post- 'Arab Spring' to an alternative vision favouring the welfare of its citizens. This is a consequence of the flexibility and willingness of Islamists there to work together in coalition with other groups even secularists.

President Mohammad Morsi managed the passage of a new constitution (presently suspended) under strong opposition but was unable to project a 'democratic' image or resolve the country's economic problems. He also failed to embrace inclusiveness even to work closely with other Islamic forces - the Salafists and the Al- Azhar institution.

Towards cyberactivism 2.0? Understanding the use of social media and other information technologies for political activism and social movements,2014,"Information technologies are increasingly important for political and social activism. In particular, web 2.0 tools and social media applications have recently played a significant role in influencing government decision making and shaping the relationships between governments, citizens, politicians, and other social actors. After the Arab Spring and the uprisings that have led to significant political changes in Egypt, Tunisia, and Iran, commentators argue that information technologies have the potential to strengthen social movements and ultimately transform society. However, this influence is not new. There were movements in the 90s, using the new technologies of e-mail and websites, which were able to gather significant social attention and generate political pressure. Based on three Mexican social and political movements that span close to 20. years, this article identifies key similarities and differences in the use of information technologies and proposes a framework to understand the evolution of cyberactivism. Initially, activists used information technologies to promote a movement's main ideas and gain global support. More recently, a single tool or application, such as Twitter, has been the technological basis for certain social and political movements. However, there is a trend towards a more integrated use of social media tools and applications, generating what could be called cyberactivism 2.0. In addition, there are some distinguishable stages in the development of social protests using information technologies; this evolutionary model seems to be useful to understand very different social and political movements using very different levels of technological sophistication.

This article explores these questions by looking into the civil war in Libya and the subsequent proliferation of weapons in the broader Sahel/North Africa region.

First, we examine the question of firearms in Libya in order to understand how changing conditions of weapons availability affected the formation of armed groups during different phases of war hostilities (February-October 2011). We highlight that, as weapons became more readily available to fighters in the field during this period, a process of fragmentation occurred, hindering efforts to build mechanisms that would allow control of the direction of the revolutionary armed movement. Next, as security continued to be a primary challenge in the new Libya, we consider the way in which unaccountable firearms and light weapons have affected the post-war landscape in the period from October 2011 to the end of 2013. Finally, we put the regional and international dimensions under scrutiny, and consider how the proliferation of weapons to nearby insurgencies and armed groups has raised major concern among Libya's neighbours. Short of establishing any causal relationship stricto sensu, we underscore the ways in which weapons from Libya have rekindled or altered local conflicts, creating permissive conditions for new tactical options, and accelerating splintering processes within armed movements in the Sahara-Sahel region.

In other words, the limited and skewed view of the Jewish community, with its near exclusion of the poor, uneducated, monolingual and religiously traditional Jewish residents of Egypt, is driven primarily by anxieties about Egyptian identity in which cosmopolitan Jews are assigned a supporting role in the play of an idealized Egypt of the past and in challenging xenophobic sentiments in the present.

Colon diversion versus primary colonic repair in gunshot abdomen with penetrating colon injury in Libyan revolution conflict 2011 (a single center experience),2014,"Purpose: The objective of this study is comparing colon diversion versus primary repair in penetrating colon gunshot injuries. Methods: A retrospective study of 63 cases of gunshot abdomen with penetrating colon injury were admitted to Al-jalla Hospital in 2011 in Benghazi, Libya. After surgical intervention, these patients were observed for any postoperative complications. Results: During the study period, 63 eligible patients included, 62 (98.4 %) were males and 1 (1.6 %) was female. And the mean age was 29.24 years. Eighteen patients had an injury on the right side of the colon, while 16, 6, 11, 6, 2, 3, and 1 patients had an injury on the transverse, left, sigmoid, rectum, right transverse, left transverse, and total colonic injury, respectively. In the first group, 23 patients (36.5 %) was treated with colon diversion, (2 with Hartmann's operation, 21 with loop colostomy). In the second group, 40 patients (63.4 %) was treated with primary repair. Eighteen (28.5 %) with right hemicolectomy, 5 (7.9 %) with transverse colon resection and anastomosis, and 17 (26.9 %) with simple repair. We evaluate the rate of postoperative complication and compare the postoperative morbidity between both groups. Conclusion: In our study, there was no significant statistical difference between types of operations and rate of complications (P=0.18). We could not see any advantage of the diversion over the primary repair. To reduce risk of the psychological trauma, complications of colostomy, unnecessary repeated hospitalization, decrease of economic cost, and complications of stoma revision operation, we should consider that the primary repair of penetrating colon injuries is an acceptable alternative method of treatment over the colostomy.

Methods: A retrospective study of 63 cases of gunshot abdomen with penetrating colon injury were admitted to Al-jalla Hospital in 2011 in Benghazi, Libya. After surgical intervention, these patients were observed for any postoperative complications. Results: During the study period, 63 eligible patients included, 62 (98.4 %) were males and 1 (1.6 %) was female. And the mean age was 29.24 years. Eighteen patients had an injury on the right side of the colon, while 16, 6, 11, 6, 2, 3, and 1 patients had an injury on the transverse, left, sigmoid, rectum, right transverse, left transverse, and total colonic injury, respectively. In the first group, 23 patients (36.5 %) was treated with colon diversion, (2 with Hartmann's operation, 21 with loop colostomy). In the second group, 40 patients (63.4 %) was treated with primary repair. Eighteen (28.5 %) with right hemicolectomy, 5 (7.9 %) with transverse colon resection and anastomosis, and 17 (26.9 %) with simple repair. We evaluate the rate of postoperative complication and compare the postoperative morbidity between both groups. Conclusion: In our study, there was no significant statistical difference between types of operations and rate of complications (P=0.18). We could not see any advantage of the diversion over the primary repair. To reduce risk of the psychological trauma, complications of colostomy, unnecessary repeated hospitalization, decrease of economic cost, and complications of stoma revision operation, we should consider that the primary repair of penetrating colon injuries is an acceptable alternative method of treatment over the colostomy.

Turkish foreign policy after the 'Arab Spring': From agenda-setter state to agenda-entrepreneur state,2014,"This article explores Turkey's changing foreign policy approach towards the Middle East after the spread of the Arab upheavals to Syria. Instead of preserving the status quo, Ankara has turned to a revisionist state that has begun to threaten Middle Eastern governments. While Turkey was reluctant to join the foreign military interventions against Middle Eastern regimes, (e.g. Libya) it has been instrumental in immersing NATO in the Syrian civil war. Such transformation ultimately undermines analyses that define Turkey as the kingmaker of the Middle East.

The culture and politics of Internet use among young people in Kuwait,2014,"While Kuwait has not joined the Arab Spring wave, there is considerable political and social turmoil in the tiny emirate. The turmoil is, for the most part, contained within the framework of Kuwait’s indigenous democratic institutions but the lines that used to clearly delineate acceptable public norms of speech and action are becoming increasingly blurred. One factor contributing to the changes is the influence new media technologies have on Kuwaiti society, especially on youth. The paper focuses on the meanings and democratic potentials of the internet for youth in the context of the Gulf Arab country of Kuwait. Through an ethnographic approach and in-depth interviews, it explores how new media reconfigure complex social, cultural, and political relationships, potentially enabling different forms of public engagement in the process.

The Challenges of Urban Transition in Yemen: Sana'a and Other Major Cities,2014,"Abstract: Although urbanisation remains low in Yemen –– 32% in 2010 –– the 2000s were marked by strong urban growth in most regions as well as by various changes that deeply affected Yemeni cities, economically, politically, and socially. After describing the current state of urbanism in Yemen, including the processes of urbanisation and the parts played by political and economic actors (local, national, and international), the paper examines the consequences of urban transformations for society by observing how Yemen's particular urban characteristics are adjusting to new forms of globalised urban development. It concludes that the assets, just as much as the limitations, of Yemeni cities, as well as their regional and international roles, should be highlighted as a reminder that the economic and political frames of these expanding cities are unstable, especially in the context of the ‘Arab Spring’, which has affected the whole country.

The African Union's Response to the Libyan Crisis: A Plea for Objectivity,2014,"The African Union (au)'s role in the Libyan crisis drew opprobrium from many observers. To some, the Union's response to the Libyan debacle - which was no response in terms of military engagement - came as no surprise. Gaddafi was one of the biggest funders of the continental organization. For others, the au's poor showing is confirmatory that African regional organizations may have the legal competence to take enforcement action against erring Member States but they have neither the resources nor the political will required to effectuate such measures. While these factors count in any reckoning of the au's handling of the Libyan crisis, this author argues that most analysts fail to account for the bewildering legal complexities the Union found itself in Libya. A closer look at the majority of existing analyses of the au's response to the Libyan crisis reveals a widely unbalanced picture painted mostly by the legal analysts' account of the organization performance and by the au's evaluation of its own performance.

Constructing Security and Community in the Middle East: A Security Community Approach to the Structure and Agents of the Arab Spring; [Ortadoğu’da Güvenlik ve Topluluk İnşa Etmek: Güvenlik Topluluğu Yaklaşımı ile Arap Baharı’nın Yapı ve Yapanları],2014,"The main purpose of this paper is to problematize whether a Middle Eastern Security Community has ever gone further than a utopian mirage. Accordingly, it is inferred that a regional security community builds upon, at least, two antecedent conditions. The needed, but not suﬃcient precondition arrives when the peoples of a region re-imagine their security geography beyond its territorialisation among the scattered islands of nation states. Suﬃcient condition is then the presence of strong regional states with ideological appeal and material resources so as to build the first momentum towards a communal sense of security. This paper argues that the Arab Spring mostly met the first condition. The communal waves, at least briefly, united Arab people divided across the borders of multitude of states. But this short-lived ‘spring’ was not quite enough to forge a path from which the region could progress along the said direction. Whereas the classical cores of strength in the Arab world (Syria, Egypt and Iraq) are currently on the edge of an ultimate collapse; two non-Arab states (Israel and Iran) seem unwilling to cover this emergent power void. @ International Relations Council of Turkey (UİK-IRCT).

The approach of Canada under the leadership of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, however, is interesting in that compared to key allies, its response evoked a highly normative-oriented and value-based response. Harper’s foreign policy approach toward Libya strongly invoked the norm of democracy and the key principles associated with it (human rights and the rule of law). These values have long been cornerstones of Canadian foreign policy; but it is through the Libyan case that we see Harper reaffirming these themes more closely to Canada’s foreign policy discourse/rationale.

Specifically, I illustrate how Turkish political actors from the Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP) have responded to structural changes taking place in the Middle East, a region that has witnessed a decrease in US hegemony and a major political reshuffle caused by the Arab revolutions. While Turkey safeguarded Western and NATO interests in the Middle East until recently and maintained a close alliance with Israel, it changed its attitude towards the latter after a series of ill-fated events such as the Israeli attack on the Mavi Marmara flotilla carrying humanitarian assistance to Gaza which resulted in the loss of life. Recent rapprochement between Turkey and Israel is explained by both actors' re-discovering common security interests in their neighbourhood, namely peace in Syria and energy interdependence.","Changes in Turkish-Israeli relations: Implications for the regional security environment This work looks at how changes to global, regional and national political landscapes played a role in shaping Turkish-Israeli relations and how this, in turn, affected regional security and development in the Middle East.

Equal or complementary?

Discourse surrounding state policy on gender, formerly the purview of elite groups, has recently been shaped and driven by popular organisations and associations. This article draws on Habermas to argue that the shift has been facilitated by the emergence of a new public sphere and engaged civil society following the fall of the Zine El Abidine Ben Ali regime in 2011. To demonstrate the emergence and diversity of Tunisian civil society, we focus on the promulgation of a new constitution and the debate surrounding Article 28, which has been contested by some Tunisians as reducing women's status to 'complementary'. A discussion of women's status in the history of Tunisian family law, especially in the popularly valorised Code of Personal Status, illustrates how women's rights were historically expanded as a top-down policy or 'politics from above'. We juxtapose this historical context with the present period of transition and constitution writing since 2011. An examination of quotations from Tunisian women, both opponents and supporters of Article 28, demonstrates the shift in Tunisia from a 'politics from above' to a 'politics from below' as women's groups are making demands upon the state and voicing their concerns in ways that have profoundly influenced the tenor of debates around gender politics in the country.

The AKP government in Turkey has become a major supporter of political change and democratization in the era of the Arab revolutions. Accumulating empirical evidence suggests, however, that the highly assertive and pro-active foreign policy of the AKP government in recent years has not been effective in terms of facilitating reform or regime change in Syria or helping to influence the direction of political change in Egypt towards a durable pluralistic order. Indeed, the policy might have been counter-productive in terms of undermining Turkey's image of a benign regional power, by drawing it to sectarian conflicts and over-engagement in the domestic politics of key Arab states. Turkey has the potential to play an important role model in the highly uncertain world of the Arab revolutions.

In Taksim, money was abolished, and everything was for free. Beyond comparing these utopian dreamscapes, Holmes's essay also addresses the movements' relationships with their really-existing military establishments. More than the ideological differences between Nasserism and Kemalism, it was the very different tradition of military coups that shaped the public's reaction to the armed forces. In Egypt, the Free Officers liberated the country from the British and built their anticolonial legacy around protecting the nation from external threats, leading to a situation in which some parts of the protest movement supported the military intervention that removed President Mohamed Morsi. In Turkey, the series of coups, in 1960, 1971, and 1980, were directed against internal threats: revolutionaries who challenged the state.

The study of democratization and the arab spring,2014,"This paper proposes and illustrates a framework for analysis of the recent events in Middle Eastern and North African countries (the so-called Arab Spring) by bringing into dialogue recent theoretical advances in democratization theory with the comparative-historical literature on the political development of the MENA region. We advocate two analytical shifts from conventional approaches in the analysis of the Arab Spring: first, reconsider the temporalities of democratization processes; second, focus on struggles over specific institutional arenas rather than over the regime as a whole. The former recommendation draws attention both to the strategies used by key actors in the political, economic, and civil society spheres, and to the historical legacies that built the influence and resources of these actors over time. The latter allows us to consider the institutional safeguards for old elites that are likely to be included in the post-authoritarian regimes emerging in the region. Even though some of these safeguards are clearly anti-democratic, historical examples show that they do not necessarily preclude democratization. Indeed, in some cases, their introduction might be necessary to achieve democratic openings in other arenas. We illustrate these theoretical points with reference to the case of Egypt.

On the (Im)possibility of Democratic Citizenship Education in the Arab and Muslim World,2014,"The euphoria of the recent Arab Spring that was initiated in northern African countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya and spilled over to Bahrain, Yemen and Syria brings into question as to whether democratic citizenship education or more pertinently, education for democratic citizenship can successfully be cultivated in most of the Arab and Muslim world. In reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates) in the Middle East, we argue that unless gender inequality, mostly instigated by religious-tribal and patriarchal perspectives, is eradicated, it would be impossible to engender any plausible conception of education for democratic citizenship in most of the Arab and Muslim world. Our thesis rests on an understanding that, firstly, education in the Arab and Muslim world is located in an impoverished view of education for Muslims; and secondly, that the notable absence of democratic citizenship is enhanced by gender-based discrimination in society especially in the professions and politics. We contend that education for democratic citizenship in the Arab and Muslim world is necessary and ought to be framed along a pluralist imaginary of citizenship. However, considering the continued prevalence of authoritarianism at politico-social levels our argument is that it seems feasible to enhance and at times disrupt the cultivation of national education drawing on some of the features of a pluralist imaginary of citizenship.

"No political agents, no diffusion: Evidence from North Africa",2014,"Following the Tunisian revolution of 2011, Arab countries witnessed different degrees of revolutionary diffusion. While some countries experienced a process of advanced diffusion, others experienced more limited forms of emulation. This paper examines the process of regional diffusion that occurred in North Africa during the first half of 2011 to show that shifts by local political agents explain these differences. Using the rich literature of informational cascades, this paper investigates the cases of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco to demonstrate that in all four countries, local political agents actively nourished or hindered the process of revolutionary diffusion that followed the Tunisian revolution. In Egypt, the strong involvement of upper-middle-class youth traditionally close to the regime signaled to the general population the presence of a historical opportunity for contestation and helped precipitate the 2011 revolution. The same logic occurred in Libya where defections of important senior members of Gadhafi's regime signaled to the Libyan population that major local actors were also dissatisfied with the leadership of the country. In contrast, major actors in Algeria and Morocco refused to mobilize against their respective governments, thus depriving nascent local demonstrations of both the visibility and the resources necessary for the inception of an informational cascade. Without a shift from local political agents, the process of regional diffusion came to an abrupt end in these two countries.

Gender and state-building in Libya: Towards a politics of inclusion,2014,"The Libyan Revolution marks a watershed moment in Libyan history and more specifically in the history of women's participation in the public space. Women were at the forefront of the demonstrations as protesters, medical workers, and aid providers, as well as organising behind the scenes and in the diaspora calling for political change and a just inclusive transition to democracy. However, they have been systematically excluded from the public sphere facing intense de-politicisation and silencing at a crucial moment in their national political transformation process. The Libyan Revolution appears here, similar to other Arab revolutions, to present a 'gender paradox'. On one hand, women are the politically empowered agents of the Revolution and change. On the other hand, they are the victims of a new kind of political violence and exclusion. Thus, there is a need to address women's participation in the public sphere from a different approach than the usual 'women's empowerment' approach. The suggested approach here is a more inclusive participatory integrated one of political and normative frameworks. Women's role should not be limited to defending women's rights issues or just their formal numerical representation in decision-making bodies. Rather they should struggle to become influential shapers of a new discourse of politics of inclusion which rests upon inclusive state-building, gender-equitable institutional reform, inclusive social transformation, demilitarisation and peace-building.

Legal Invisibility and the Revolution: Statelessness in Egypt,2014,"Recent political turmoil has focused international attention on Egypt, yet there is little awareness of the country's stateless populations-those who lack legal nationality to any state-or the challenges they face. Individuals in situations of protracted statelessness are denied their right to a nationality, resulting in an array of additional rights violations. Such violations include denied freedom of movement, equality before the law, and access to economic and social rights. Drawing from two years' of fieldwork data, this study highlights the plight of those who are unable to achieve legal status in a country with harsh punishments for illegal presence, entry, and exit. It also evaluates potential solutions for eliminating statelessness in Egypt and protecting the rights of stateless populations. As Egypt seeks to move beyond revolution, it is vital that the government addresses the pervasive and systemic inequalities that deny individuals their right to a nationality.

"Process of decolonization in nābulyūn fī Al-Azhar ""napoleon in Al-Azhar""",2014,"This paper examines the decolonization process in Najib Al-Kailani's novel, Nābulyūn fī al-Azhar (Napoleon in Al-Azhar-1980). The study explores the ways the colonized react to the colonizers in order regain liberty, freedom, and sovereignty of their land. Decolonization is the reverse process of colonization by which colonies become independent of the colonizing country. Najib Al-Kailani (1931 - 1995) is an Egyptian novelist, poet, and critic. In his writings, he focuses on the colonial experiences that the Arabs and Muslims have faced throughout history. Al-Kailani here wrote a revisionist novel recounting the French invasion of Egypt in the eighteenth century (1798-1801) commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 - 5 May 1821), the general in Chief of what they called at that time Armée d'Orient (English: Army of the Orient) and depicts the people's resistance and rebellion against the colonizer. The novel depicts the Egyptian resistance, against French subjugation and humiliation, and sacrifices for the sake of independence and dignity. The analysis of decolonization based on the events in the novel is executed by applying Frantz Fanon's theory of resistance and revolution which embodies three stages and steps of decolonization. These stages are: assimilation to the colonizer's culture, rediscovery of their own culture and identity, and finally the confrontation with the colonialists. Colonized people usually do not reach the confrontation stage with the colonizer unless they go through the first two stages; assimilation and rediscovery. The paper also discusses the impact of the violence experienced by both the colonizer and the colonized as a result of the confrontation.","Process of decolonization in nābulyūn fī Al-Azhar ""napoleon in Al-Azhar"" This paper examines the decolonization process in Najib Al-Kailani's novel, Nābulyūn fī al-Azhar (Napoleon in Al-Azhar-1980).

Furthermore, this relationship is not simply a function of support for political Islam. Evidence suggests that motivation mechanisms rather than political resources are the reason behind this result.

This paper assesses the strengths and limitations of each path, arguing that social movements and progressive parties together may possess the best chances for making radical social change in this new situation.

The Ikhwanization of the Salafis: Piety in the Politics of Egypt and Kuwait,2014,"This article discusses how to make sense of the seeming paradox of the hitherto apolitical salafis forming parties and joining the competitive political scene. A dominant salafi attitude has been that Islam dictates for the ordinary believer absolute obedience to the ruler, the wali al-amr, even when that ruler is a less-than-pious Muslim and may deviate from the word of God. At the outset of the movement that led to the fall of Husni Mubarak, this attitude led salafis openly to criticize the demonstrations as impious rebellion against the wali al-amr. Yet, as the new political set-up after the revolution took shape, large segments of the salafi movement exhibited a newfound belief in the legitimacy of competition for elected political power. The article argues that Salafism best can be seen as a movement for moral purity and individual piety in a rapidly changing society, much akin to the early Muslim Brothers and to the early beginnings of the Egyptian Islamic student movement of the 1970s. And once the step into active political engagement is taken, the salafis come to deal with strong forces pushing them along the path earlier traversed by the Muslim Brothers, al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun, leading to a more pragmatic understanding of what it means to further the cause of Islam.

Dynamic interactions between Egyptian equity and currency markets prior to and during political unrest,2014,"Since the January 2011 uprising, Egypt has undergone an ongoing political unrest, which has weighed heavily on the country's financial markets. This article aims to investigate the existence and nature of first and second moment interdependencies between the stock and currency markets of Egypt before and during the recent 2011 uprising. This investigation is conducted in the context of a bivariate EGARCH framework augmented with cointegrating residuals as an exogenous variable in both the conditional mean and conditional variance equations. The results indicate that during the pre-uprising period, there exist reciprocal mean spillover effects between the equity and currency markets. However, during the in-uprising period, only unidirectional mean spillover effects from the equity market to the currency counterpart is detected. Additionally, over both periods, a unidirectional volatility transmission from the equity market to the currency counterpart is observed. The response pattern of volatility is found to be asymmetric. In general, these results demonstrate the leading role of the stock market with respect to the currency counterpart, lending support to the portfolio balance approach. The evidence presented in this article holds important implications for investors and policymakers.

This study conducted interviews with eight journalists who report on Islam as a part of their beat in Egyptian publications and a news framing analysis was performed on articles relating to Islam in English-language Egyptian news sources Al Ahram Weekly, Daily News Egypt, and Al-Masry Al-Youm in the months before Arab Spring radically altered the shape of the country.

Can oil-reliant countries democratize? An assessment of the role of civil society in Algeria,2014,"A cursory look around the world shows that few oil-reliant countries can be categorized as democracies, particularly those in the Middle East. In fact, many studies have suggested that oil wealth hinders democratization. The recent ""Arab Spring"" and subsequent political instability in oil-producing states such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Syria gives rise to questions regarding the prospects for democracy in these types of countries. This article provides an analysis of the possible role that civil society may play in democratization in oil-reliant states by looking at the case of Algeria. I argue that the seemingly meaningless and artificial acts of ""liberalization"" initiated by the Algerian government in the late 1980s, which initially allowed civic associations to form, have provided an opening for some civic associations to organize and oppose the government. This process of liberalization, regardless of how empty it may have seemed at first, has ""opened floodgates"" that now cannot be closed. Thus, the recent protests in Algeria, and continued opposition to the government, can be seen as directly facilitated by the government's prior liberalization and opening of the system to civic associations.

Concise comparative summaries (CCS) of large text corpora with a human experiment,2014,"In this paper we propose a general framework for topic-specific summarization of large text corpora and illustrate how it can be used for the analysis of news databases. Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. CCS is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. For a particular topic of interest (e.g., China or energy), CSS automatically labels documents as being either on- or off-topic (usually via keyword search), and then uses sparse classification methods to predict these labels with the high-dimensional counts of all the other words and phrases in the documents. The resulting small set of phrases found as predictive are then harvested as the summary. To validate our tool, we, using news articles from the New York Times international section, designed and conducted a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of ""Egypt"" in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times' and Wall Street Journal's coverage of ""energy."" Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size.

Turmoil in Egypt - 1968-2011: the status of the armed forces in citizen uprisings in Egypt,2014,"On 15 January 2011, there occurred an unprecedented event in the annals of Arab states: for the first time, the masses revolted and ousted a local ruler. The Tunisian masses took to the streets and stayed there until Zayn al-'Ābidīn bin 'Alī stepped down, or, rather, fled the country. Ten days after Bin 'Alī's fall, the masses filled the thoroughfares of Egypt's major cities and demanded the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years. On 12 February 2011, after 18 days of stormy protests, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation and announced that Mubarak's powers had been transferred to him. This paper follows the Egyptian saga in the context of the new phenomenon taking place across the Arab world - citizen revolts. It does not address the protests by Islamic opposition groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood; instead, it offers case studies in social, economic, and ideological (one might even say, secular) contexts, not religious ones. It surveys the recent epoch-making events in the Nile region and compares them with violent demonstrations and riots in its past. The paper's importance lies in its examination of the role of the armed forces in each case and primarily in its investigation of the assertion that the broad-based uprisings seem to have written finis to the military's pivotal role in Arab states.

Digital Spring? New media and new politics on the campus,2014,"Whilst the dynamics informing processes have taken time to become clear, civic resistance initiated by young people using new media began in Egypt in 2010 against the Mubarak regime, soon widened to Tunisia, Yemen and Libya. Known as the 'Arab Spring', this phenomenon re-ignited discussion about the political role of digital space and its democratic potential. While parallels between authoritarian regimes and universities and educational institutions might seem overdrawn to some readers, I suggest there is value in considering the 'Digital Spring' (apropos the 'Arab Spring') as a metaphor to suggest the possibility that similar processes are taking place in schools and universities. This invites discussion about the political significance of digital space and its democratic potential in those institutions. To assess how some young people engage in digitally mediated politics within schools and universities, I identify five propositions which amalgamate descriptive and normative elements derived from Habermas and Dahlgren. These propositions offer an ideal taxonomy of normative and descriptive elements to establish whether digital technology promotes participation and debate in ways that sustain democratic practice.

This move toward developing and sustaining effective education provision for the national citizenry gained greater importance in the wake of the Arab Spring movement that swept across the region. Although not as directly impacted as some other Arab nations further north, the leadership of Gulf States recognized that the large youth demographic in the region needed greater education and employment options, partly to stem the tide of unrest in their own nations. Many Gulf States, including the Kingdom of Bahrain, were already looking overseas for education models and systems that they could ""buy-in"" and implement in local schools. One such provider that seemed attractive to Bahrain, among others, was Singapore, which is widely hailed in the Gulf region as a model of a high-performing, global economy and education system. Yet importation of foreign models, with little or no accommodations made for local needs and cultures leads to an uncomfortable ""grafting"" of systems that seem out of place. This, coupled with the desire by Gulf States to take part in international benchmarking exercises, such as TIMSS, has created an awkward skewing in many educational practices and processes in Bahrain and other GCC states.

Factors influencing voting intentions for Egyptian parliament elections 2011,2014,"Purpose: This study measures to what extent different factors including Islamic religious beliefs influenced Egyptian's voting behavior intentions in the last parliament elections, given the moderating effect of the media and its role in shaping the existence of the Islamic political brand in Egypt. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research was initially conducted to modify the Newman and Sheth model to fit the Egyptian culture. A final total of 401 Muslim citizens that participated in the last parliament elections were then surveyed via face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Findings: Most factors related to voting for a specific candidate or party seemed to be important for voters' in their decision making, specifically personal events related to the candidate, candidate's image, current events surrounding the elections process, interest in issues and policies and religious beliefs that was added by the authors to the model. The media also had a high level of importance and influence over the relationship between some of the factors affecting voter's decision and voter's behavioral intentions. Overall, citizens demonstrated approach voting behavioral intentions towards the elections process and indicated that they would actively participate in the upcoming elections. Pearson correlations and further analysis were also run to investigate the nature of relationships between the factors understudy and voting behavioral intentions; most of which had significant relationships, as well as the significant role of the media. Some factors were excluded after running stepwise regression for testing the fitness of the model proposed. Research limitations/implications: Study covering the capital city of Egypt; Cairo only. Practical implications: It has become important for politicians and governments to understand what are the genuine needs of their societies and what are citizens looking for in political candidates and parties. Political marketing and particularly understanding voting behavior is a booming area that has become an important tool for building political brands as witnessed by this research and how it was used by Islamists to reach voter's and affect their decision making. Originality/value: This research paper sheds the light on a very contemporary area related to political marketing which is political campaigning and factors affecting voters' intentions given the significant role of candidate's religious beliefs.

Challenges of thinking feminism and revolution in Egypt between 2011 and 2014,2014,"The approach to politics by ruling elites in Egypt has been consistently patriarchal. In this context, feminism stands as a resilient revolutionary force, which over the twentieth and the twenty first century contributes to the complex cultural process that Michael Hardt conceptualizes as 'human revolution'. Building on this concept, and on the history of Egyptian feminism, this essay analyzes the 25th January Revolution as a challenge to the remnants of the patriarchal culture. If feminized bodies, as the site of cultural and political contestation, have been constructed, in both nationalist and colonial discourses, as objects in need of protection, women's agency has challenged these narratives and, in the context of the 2011 revolution, has re-shaped the discourse about protection. The views and actions of the emerging women's movement are situated along the extended line of the feminist revolution, which here is examined through the methodology of oral history. Focusing on cultural, more than institutional, change, and shedding light on the shift from women to gender agency, this essay investigates the strategies through which the young revolutionaries in Egypt today are creating a new political discourse, imagining new forms of political participation.

Iranian Involvement in Yemen,2014,"For at least a decade, there have been numerous Yemeni, Saudi, and other countries' assertions that Iran has been involved in supporting northern Yemeni rebels seeking autonomy from the Sana'a government. Iranian diplomatic and political support for this rebellious group (known as the Houthis) is undeniable, but Iranian military assistance for them has not always been easy to prove. This situation appeared to change in 2011 when Iran's increased involvement in Yemen occurred in response to both the chaotic situation there during the final year of the Saleh regime and the danger that the Arab Spring revolutions would leave Iran increasingly isolated. Evidence of Iranian efforts to supply weapons to the Houthis now seems overwhelming in contrast to uncertain reports prior to 2011. In addition, at least some of Yemen's southern secessionists also appear to be receiving at least limited Iranian financial support.

We identify two dimensions that affect voting outcomes at the constituency level: socioeconomic profile and the electoral institutional framework. Our results show that education is negatively associated with Islamist voting. Interestingly, we find significant evidence suggesting that higher poverty levels are associated with a lower vote share for Islamist parties. Exploiting the sequential voting setup, we show that later voting stages have not resulted in stronger support for the already winning Islamist parties (i.e., there is no bandwagon effect).

The Tourism Industry and the Process of Internationalization in the Middle East: The Example of Jordan,2014,"Ongoing internationalization processes have resulted in significant changes on the supply side in many fields of the economy and specifically in tourism. Although the scientific discourse is working hard to keep pace with these rapid changes, there is nevertheless a considerable deficit in research on the problems and risks as well as the potential and opportunities associated with intensifying processes of internationalization. This paper focuses on the internationalization process of small and medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) in the Middle East, specifically in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which continues to be a tourist destination for Westerners in spite of major political and other crises. Internationalization of SMTEs is a complex process, and studies that take a more holistic view of this phenomenon are needed. This paper will therefore attempt to investigate the internationalization process in Jordan from a problem-centred perspective and to critically examine and discuss it on the basis of comments made by leading actors in the Jordanian tourism business. The thus gained insights should help to reduce the still existing theoretical deficits in the study of the internationalization process. Particularly, the impact of the Arab Spring on the Jordanian tourism market must be included in a critical assessment.

The political institutional and firm governance determinants of liquidity: Evidence from North Africa and the Arab Spring,2014,"This study undertakes a unique comparison into the relative efficacy of four well established liquidity measures, namely turnover, proportion of daily zero returns, Amihud (2002) and Liu (2006), in explaining the bid-ask spread plus brokerage costs when powerful and common firm governance mechanisms are taken into account as controls. These are representative of ownership of listed firms by state, long term foreign partners, entrepreneurial founders, single family entities, extended family groups and business networks, domestic and foreign venture capitalists. An additional control for firms within business network controlled by former Tunisian premier, Ben Ali, and Morocco's royal family is also included. Using a unique sample of all listed firms across the equity markets of Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria I find evidence of equity capital rationing during the Arab Spring period of political upheaval. Less well regulated SME markets such as Morocco's marche croissance have liquidity-based transactions costs attributable to Arab Spring four times those of the marche principal while those in Egypt's Nilex are twenty times those of the prestigious EGX30 index. Finally the greatest changes in political risks associated with aggregate liquidity across the Arab Spring are democratic accountability, military in politics, and law and order.

The reformasi '98 and the arab spring: A comparative study of popular uprisings in Indonesia and Tunisia,2014,"By comparing popular uprisings in Indonesia and Tunisia, this article intends to answer the questions: What kind of condition made the Islamists successfully take over the state in Tunisia, while they failed to do so in Indonesia? What are the similarities and differences between the uprisings in these two countries? This article argues that the historical and sociopolitical position of Islamists during the authoritarian regimes determined the fate of Islamist parties after the uprisings. The role of Ennahda party as a symbol of opposition has contributed to its rise after the Tunisian Spring, while the involvement of Islamists in the regime during the last years of Suharto's rule contributed to the decline of Islamist parties in Indonesia. However, the strongest argument for the decline of Islamist parties in Indonesia is the fading away of political streams. Furthermore, the role of Muslim scholars in desacralizing Islamist parties in Indonesia has significantly challenged and undermined the identification of Islam with Islamist parties.

Getting inside the black box: HR practices and firm performance within the Tunisian financial services industry,2014,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore, and eventually unlocking, the ""black box"" problem by addressing the potential mediating role of human capital and organizational commitment in the relationship between high performance work systems (HPWS) and perceived firm performance in the Tunisian financial industry. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the strategic human resource management (SHRM) theory, the authors developed a model that links HPWS to perceived organizational performance through human capital and employee organizational commitment. Data collected from 351 respondents was considered. Multiple regression analysis was then used to assess the research hypotheses. Findings: Data collected from 351 respondents suggest that HPWS positively affect perceived firm performance through first, enhancing the firms' human capital; and second, developing positive organizational commitment attitude among employees. In addition, a direct relationship between HPWS and firm performance was found. Research limitations/implications: The research focussed on the perceived performance of the organization rather than financial measures. Also, because data were collected from a sample of Tunisian financial companies, results of this study are not generalizable. Originality/value: More than two decades after the earliest contributions, the SHRM scholars believe that the ""black box"" problem is still accurate and, therefore, needs to be addressed in an effective way. At a general and broad level, the authors believe this study contributes to the SHRM literature by successfully addressing two critical ""black box"" elements, i.e. human capital and organizational commitment. Also, since there is a lack in such research in Tunisia, an icon country of the Arab spring, this paper provides theoretical basis for future research and managerial implications for Tunisian business leaders and HR managers. Finally, this research is extending the current empirical SHRM literature by addressing the critical role of HRM in the largely understudied field of financial services industry.

Informal settlements in the Syrian conflict: Urban planning as a weapon,2014,"Insurgency and war in Syria have induced changes in urban policies towards informal sett lements. Syrian urban policies in the 2000s set the issue of informal sett lements as a priority item on the agenda. The reform of the legislative urban frameworks, designed with international assistance, and new master plans encouraged both their regularization and upgrading and their renewal (destruction/ reconstruction). While competition between these models and objectives delayed decisions and programme implementation in Damascus, the beginnings of the 'Arab Spring' elsewhere in the region influenced the orientation of these policies, showing the diff erent ways in which urban planning can be used for strategic purposes. Initially, the Syrian uprising led to an inflexion of policies towards more social options for regularization. Subsequently, as it developed into an armed conflict, and with the escalation of physical destruction, the urban renewal option was favoured and overlapped military targets. Thus conflict, destruction and displacements have led to all urban options being put back on the table with the view to future reconstruction.

The concept of brotherhood: Beyond Arendt and the Muslim Brotherhood,2013,"Hannah Arendt claims the concept of brotherhood presents false notions of political community that elide historic hatreds of others and threaten modern political life. This paper explores Arendts critical assessment of the concept of brotherhood in order to reflect on one specific example: the politics of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the wake of the Arab Spring of 2011. While some observers reject Arendts assessment of brotherhood as too narrow, her criticisms raise useful questions about democracy and plurality, which confront any community that exhorts its members to act as brethren rather than as citizens. The Muslim concept of brotherhood suggests many different possibilities for belonging: a classic universalism of the Abrahamic natural law tradition; a progressive counter-public sphere; and as well the authoritarian private community of believers as represented in the early writings of the Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Therefore, the politically controversial Muslim Brotherhood has no monopoly over the understanding of the Muslim concept of brotherhood. However, it is the most powerful, most well-organized brotherhood movement. The paper opens and ends with reflections on the Arab Spring of 2011, its one-year anniversary in January 2012, and considers other possibilities for the concept of brotherhood against the backdrop of Arendts analysis.

Throughout this period, Russian diplomats were able to continue their traditional partnership with many Ottoman Greek prelates even after the Bulgarian schism of 1872.

It particularly traces the rift between theoretical Muslim discourse about Islamic tolerance towards other faiths and its implementation or the absence thereof in practice. It concludes that so far no real progress has been made and that, for the relationship to evolve, Islam needs to proceed to a state in which it sees itself as no more than an equal to other religions. The recognition of its tradition-based nature and of the consequences that flow from such a realization for the treatment of its fundamental sources, the Qur'an and the Sunna, will be addressed. To evaluate the current situation and the outlook, we shall use the example of the famous eighteenth-century German play by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Nathan the Wise, about the occupation of Jerusalem by Saladin.

Paradox of globalization: New Arab publics? new social contract?,2013,"Because social media is playing an irrefutable role in the Arab Spring uprisings the central question in this article is to what extent Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in general, and social media in specif.ic, are contributing to the democratization of the public sphere and shifting the monopoly on agenda setting in the Arab Gulf, particularly in the case of Bahrain? How will these technologies continue to shape contentious politics in the Middle East and will their utility for democratizing and expanding the public sphere persist in the aftermath of the Arab Spring? Or will the increasing liberalization of media and freedom of expression that had preceded the Arab Spring experience a repressive backlash as authoritarian states attempt to clamp down on social and traditional media-or even harness them for their own purposes as seen by Facebook intimidation campaigns against activists in Bahrain last Spring. Finally-using the lens of social movement theory-what repertoires of contention and political opportunity structures will pro-democracy activists use to keep their campaigns alive? Activists in the Gulf have not only incorporated the ICTs into their repertoire, but have also changed substantially what counts as activism, what counts as community, collective identity, democratic space, public sphere, and political strategy. Ironically this new technology has succeeded in reviving and expanding the practice of discursive dialog that had once characterized traditional tribal politics in the Arabian Peninsula.

Towards an urban alternative for Kuwait: Protests and public participation,2014,"With the launch of its oil industry in 1946 and the advent of modern planning in 1950, Kuwait underwent a rapid, state-led modernization process that resulted in the complete transformation of its urban landscape. With this process, Kuwait's inhabitants lost what French urban theorist Henri Lefebvre refers to as a 'right to the city'. As the population was suburbanized en masse, the city was transformed into a landscape of state power and ceased to be a centre of political discussion and debate as it had been prior to oil. At the same time, with state planning the public lost the right to participate in the production of a city based on their particular needs and desires. It has only been in recent years - more than half a century after the advent of oil - that a quest for a restored centrality has started to emerge among various social forces in Kuwait. This paper focuses on two parallel though significantly different groups that are simultaneously demanding a restoration of a right to the city: political opposition forces, who have brought public protest back into the heart of the city centre (after fifty years) in the public park now known as Irada Square, and a civil society group called the Arabana Project that has been advocating for greater public participation in urban planning and development for the first time in Kuwait's history.","Towards an urban alternative for Kuwait: Protests and public participation With the launch of its oil industry in 1946 and the advent of modern planning in 1950, Kuwait underwent a rapid, state-led modernization process that resulted in the complete transformation of its urban landscape.

Syria today is a country of blurred facts and wild rumors, but the abduction and in some cases murder of Christian clerics is real enough.

Egyptian salafism in revolution,2014,"The political breakthrough of Salafism during and after the revolts in the Arab world in 2011-12 has challenged established descriptions of Salafism as an apolitical form of Islamic activism. Nowhere is the political breakthrough clearer than in Egypt where, in 2011-12, three Salafi parties contested the first free elections in decades. This article charts the impact that entry into politics has had on Egyptian Salafism, and how it has related to other political actors. We conclude that despite homogeneity on the ideological and theological level, Salafism as a social movement in Egypt presents several different faces, and that it is just as prone to the influence of the political context as other social and religious movements. Salafism has proven remarkably flexible in its adaptation to the new political reality in Egypt-something that contradicts established accounts that categorize it as a rigid, theology-focused movement.

Arab springs making space: Territoriality and moral geographies for asylum seekers in Italy,2013,"This paper engages the instabilities of the category of 'asylum' looking at Arab Uprisings' mobility to Italy and highlighting the contested encounter between governmental practices in managing asylum seekers and the embodied experiences of mobility from Libya and Tunisia to Italy in 2011-12. Focusing on asylum application processing, our analysis tackles its sorting rationalities (asylum seekers versus irregular migrants, country of birth versus country of refuge), its produced spatialities (processing centers and 'humanitarian emergency zones'), and its moral predicaments (how vulnerability and protection are put to work). Our aim is to contribute to a political epistemology of asylum whereby asylum's normative instabilities are mobilized to trouble its exclusionary boundaries and the profiling of the refugee as the alter ego figure of the citizen. The paper revolves around four episodes: it opens attending to an epistemological challenge; it stages a critical engagement with the Italian 'North Africa Emergency' in the second and third section; finally, it puts this analysis to work on the terrain of a political struggle to demand a right to presence for Libyan war evacuees.","Arab springs making space: Territoriality and moral geographies for asylum seekers in Italy This paper engages the instabilities of the category of 'asylum' looking at Arab Uprisings' mobility to Italy and highlighting the contested encounter between governmental practices in managing asylum seekers and the embodied experiences of mobility from Libya and Tunisia to Italy in 2011-12.

Changes occurred in both arenas which influenced the stability of the regime and led the country to a civil war. In the domestic political arena, the regime ceased to rely on a Maronite-Sunni-Shiite axis and began to rely firstly on a Maronite-Shiite axis, and then on a Maronite-Druze axis. These steps aroused the Sunni establishment against the regime and led to instability. In the foreign arena, the regime exchanged their policy of neutrality on Arab and international arenas in favour of leaning towards 'revolutionary' Arab countries such as Syria, Iraq and Libya. This led to a rise in the influence and intervention of these Arab countries in Lebanese political affairs and escalated the turbulence on the streets of Lebanon against the Frangieh regime.

I then characterize the role of children in the Syrian uprising as a three-stage cycle, whereby children unwittingly sparked the revolution, then were targeted by the regime in response, and finally, have been, along with adults across the country, spurred to further anti-Assad action, rather than silence and submission, as a result of the regime's brutality. Providing empirical evidence to illustrate how this cycle plays out in Syria, I suggest that additional research is needed to further examine and theorize about the role of children in social movements and regime transitions.

"Good copt, bad copt: Competing narratives on coptic identity in Egypt and the United States",2013,"This study analyses the relationship between the Coptic community in the United States and Egyptian Copts regarding the status of Coptic citizenship in the Egyptian state. The conception of citizenship for the Coptic Christian minority has been debated since the formation of the modern nation-state and has acquired greater relevance after the revolution that brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power. One primary narrative of citizenship is promoted by the Egyptian Church. It recognises that, while Copts may not feel like equal citizens, they are devoted to their homeland. They try to promote greater equality through civil discourse, opposing foreign intervention and seeking to foster positive relations with Egypt's Muslims. While many Diaspora Copts echo the message of the Egyptian Church, a minority of activist Copts have challenged that narrative. Inculcated with ideas of Islamophobia and neoconservatism, they tend to dismiss hopes of national unity and focus rather on incidents of persecution. These diaspora activist groups continue to challenge the Coptic Church. Their policies have influenced American foreign policy and have broader implications for Muslim-Christian relations in Egypt. &copy; Edinburgh University Press.","Good copt, bad copt: Competing narratives on coptic identity in Egypt and the United States This study analyses the relationship between the Coptic community in the United States and Egyptian Copts regarding the status of Coptic citizenship in the Egyptian state.

We examined the psychology of support for Arab ascendancy among adults in 14 nations in the Balkans, the Middle East, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America. We predicted and found that people low on social dominance orientation endorsed forming an independent Palestinian state and desired that the Arab uprisings succeed. Rejection of ideologies that legitimize outside interference with Arabs mediated this support. Measures and model results were robust across world regions.

Forensic analysis of ocular injuries during the 2011 revolution in Egypt,2013,"Introduction: During the year 2011 the Egyptian revolution arose with a change in the trend of eye trauma in Egypt. Aim of work: This study aims at reviewing the epidemiology of ocular trauma presenting to Ain Shams University teaching hospital during the year 2011 and comparing it with epidemiology during the previous 5 years. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective epidemiological and clinical study of patients admitted to Ain Shams University Hospital with ocular trauma from 2006 till 2011. Cases were analyzed with respect to age, sex, occupation, admission interval, type, mode, time and place of injury, causative instrument, diagnosis and examination findings, investigations, management and visual outcomes. Results: Total numbers of cases presenting during the year 2011 was 237 cases. The mean age was 22.5 years. Students (47.2%) and jobless people (21.9%) constituted the majority of the sample.During the year 2011 there was a significant increase in the percentage of injuries occurring in the street. There was also a significant rise in the percentage of homicidal ocular injuries specially those caused from non-rifled weapons.Fourteen cases of endophthalmitis were associated with non-rifled fire arm missiles while 7 were associated with glass intra-ocular foreign body. This indicated that the probability of occurrence of endophthalmitis with metal intraocular foreign bodies was 2:3 i.e. 66.6% where as in glass intra ocular foreign body was 7:9 i.e. 77.7%. Conclusion: The majority of ocular trauma in our population during the year 2011 was due to homicidal street injuries occurring mainly in males of young age group, which is consistent with the events occurring in Egypt in this year. The findings indicate that ocular trauma is a significant cause of visual loss in this population.

We find between 22.1% (Jordan) and 54.7% (Yemen) participated in either the signing of petitions, or marching in street protests, or both between the years 2003-07. To explain student protest participation, we draw from the political economy literature to test four grievance-based hypotheses that link protest to student perceptions on the performance of the economy, personal family socioeconomic status, political exclusion, and preference for democracy. Ordered probit regression analyses indicate that students protest for different reasons in the four countries. We find statistical evidence that student protests are associated with grievances about the economy (Algeria and Morocco) and lack of democracy (Algeria only). Joint hypothesis tests reveal that the four grievances jointly matter in Algeria, Morocco, and Yemen but not Jordan.

The Syrian Crisis: A systemic framework,2014,"There is as yet no framework for understanding the Syrian Crisis (herein referred to as 'the Syrian Crisis'; the Syrian Crisis or simply 'the Crisis') or more generally the Arab Spring. There are many arguments that are often inconsistent. A framework can help further socio-political and economic analysis and synthesis and will facilitate the convergence of conflicting views on a solution. This article is intended to provide a systemic framework for the Syrian Crisis that can be extended to other Arab experiences. Syrians have split into three main categories vis-à-vis the Crisis: pro-government, pro-revolt and a silent middle. The contention here that, regardless of classification or intentions, events on the ground and the accompanying political manoeuvres point collectively to the conclusion that the revolt became a tool in the toolbox for Syrian realignment ideologically and geopolitically under the pretence of a just revolt. The argument advanced is that there is a plan for the realignment of Syria that uses the revolt as an entrance point and a tool in this strategy - whether the Syrians engaged in revolt know it or not. The Syrian people, the Syrian government and the rebels have borne the entire risk throughout the induced Crisis with no control over aspects of its trajectory. The complexity of the Syrian Crisis comes from two simultaneous confluences: an ideological confluence and geopolitical confluence. In his exposition of this strategy the author posits that, for the plan to succeed, it may be necessary to destroy the fabric of Syrian society by discrediting Syrian nationalism, Arab nationalism and moderate Islamism through supporting sectarianism, subnationalism, regionalism and Islamic fundamentalism to achieve the desired realignment under the banner of humanitarian intervention. The course of action adopted by the external opposition does not align with a revolution for the people of Syria. The sponsors of the plan discerned here deployed Islamist Jihadism as a universal catalytic enabler of Syria's destruction without appearing to be supporting terrorism for regime change in Syria. The losers are the Syrian people, their infrastructure, their unity and possibly their statehood, and many innocent lives. The author introduces two new analytic tools to facilitate the discussion: the 'ideogram' and the 'geogram'.

The case for Azawad: Rectifying the past to save the future in Northern Africa,2013,"Since Mali achieved independence from France, the marginalised Tuareg population of Mali has sought independence and the right to form their own nation, 'Azawad'. These efforts have continuously been frustrated by the Tuaregs' neighbours, due to competing nationalist pride and interests in the mineral resources believed to lie under the northern Malian soil. Thus far, the Tuaregs of northern Mali have been largely neglected and denied both inclusive and effective governance by the various Malian governments from the southern Malian capital of Bamako. When negotiations have failed, Tuareg attempts to seize their own independence through violence have been brutally crushed by the Malian government. The Malian government will neither advance the interests of the Tuaregs nor allow them the freedom to pursue their own path in the world. The advent of the 'Arab Spring' in Libya provided another opportunity for the Tuaregs to pursue their dreams of an independent Azawad. Tuareg fighters returning from Libya carried with them both considerable combat experience and stockpiles of arms that they used to temporarily free their homeland. Unfortunately, the Tuaregs' whirlwind conquest of northern Mali was undone by the emergence of a new transnational threat in the Sahel. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) supplanted the previously victorious Tuaregs and attempted to turn Azawad into a Taliban-esque caliphate. French intervention defeated AQIM, but set the stage for a continuation of the cycle of violence and instability borne from the unwillingness of the international community to support the Tuaregs' legitimate right to self-determination.

The place of Shi’i clerics in the first Iranian constitution,2013,"Despite their regional, ethnic, and linguistic differences, the recent social and political upheavals of the Middle East have shared one basic concern. From the 2009 Green Movement in Iran to the 2011 Tunisian revolts which ignited the Arab Uprisings, and from the first Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2012 to the protests in Turkey’s Taksim Square in 2013, a central issue has been how to establish a democratic state with a modern constitution while adhering to many shari’a rules and regulations. This debate is not a new one in the Middle East and, as this article will demonstrate, it has been a central theme of Iranian politics ever since the Constitutional Revolution of 1906. At the time of that first Iranian revolution, Iran was ruled by two sets of laws, shari’a religious law and ‘urf customary law. Shi’i clerics, with their elaborate institutional hierarchy, controlled shari’a law, which was considered the more important law of the land, whereas the monarch and local rulers were nominal guardians of ‘urf laws. Soon the novel discourses of the Constitutional Revolution would create a paradigm shift in Iranian society.1 Constitutionalist clerics had assumed that a new political order reformed ‘urf rulings, leaving shari’a laws more or less intact. They were stunned by the realization that a constitutional order revamped both legal systems and overturned sacrosanct social and religious hierarchies. Many clerics resisted these reforms. The result was a bifurcated set of laws that institutionalized clerical authority, while also placing limits on clerics in legislative and judicial branches of the government.

In our contribution we want to analyze the political dynamics of these uprisings beyond the salient immediacy of the revolutionary events, by taking, as our guide, Rosa Luxemburg's pamphlet The Mass Strike (2005 [1906], London: Bookmarks). An interesting theoretical contribution to the study of revolution, Luxemburg's book provides us with tools to introduce a historical and political reading of the Arab Spring. Based on fieldwork and thorough knowledge of the region, we draw from evidence from the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions and the more gradual forms of political change in Morocco. Re-reading the revolutionary events in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco through the lens of The Mass Strike offers activists on the ground insights into the dialectic between local and national struggles, economic and political demands, strike actions and revolution. The workers protests in Tunisia and Egypt during the last decade can be grasped as anticipations of the mass strike during the revolution; the specific mode in which workers participate as a class in the revolutionary process. This perspective enables an understanding of the current economic conflicts as logical forms of continuity of the revolution. The economic and the political, the local and the national (and one may add the global), are indissoluble yet separate elements of the same process, and the challenge for revolutionary actors in Tunisia and Egypt lies in the connection, organization and fusion of these dispersed moments and spaces of struggle into a politicized whole. Conversely, an understanding of the reciprocity between revolutionary change and the mass strike allows activists in Morocco to recognize the workers' movement as a potentially powerful actor of change, and trade unionists to incorporate the political in their economic mobilizations.

This article suggests that pluralism and diversity lie at the core of Alawite political preferences and what's more, according to Alawite perspectives, this is what God intended. Between 1832 and 1973 Alawites made gradual progress towards genuine integration into Syrian society, however, the confluence of two factors marked a turning point in this process: the mobilisation of Alawite 'asabiyya by the al-Asad regime and a renewed perception of Sunni Muslim intolerance.

Interpreting the North African Arab Spring: Based on a four-stage model of economic injustice and peace,2013,"In this paper, four scholars, one from, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and the United States respectively, examine the relationship between Structural Economic Injustice (SEI) and economic peace in the context of the revolutionary transformation of the North African Arab Spring countries of Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. The article proposes a four-stage model of economic injustice and peace consisting of: 1) Dysfunctional Stability; 2) Upheaval; 3) Transition; and 4) Restabilisation, which could lead to a return to a new form of unjust dysfunctional stability or a new functional stability that results in societal transformation based on democratisation and greater economic peace. It is suggested that due to various factors-including the influence of new information flows supplied by business and other vehicles, and the popular response to entrenched SEI-the region which had long remained in a state of dysfunctional stability, erupted in upheavals that became known as the Arab Spring. Following the disruption of those upheavals these countries entered the dangerous Transition period in which they currently find themselves. The key question is how each country will manage the quest for restabilisation. At this point, the outcome is uncertain, although there are both positive and negative signs associated with each country.

Using Alexander's social performance model to study nationalist contention, it examines how a Muslim prayer ritual was re-purposed by Moroccan nationalists to galvanise mass protest against a French divide-and-rule colonial policy towards Moroccan Berbers that they believed threatened Morocco's ethno-religious national unity. By looking at how national identity was forged in the context of contentious performances and why certain religious (Islam) and ethnic (Arab) components were drawn on to define the Moroccan nation, this study offers a model for answering why national identity gets defined in specific ways and how the nation gains salience for broader publics as a category of collective identity.

The politics of scorn in Syria and the agency of narrated involvement,2013,"Recent uprisings across the Arab world raise the question of how populations living under dictatorial regimes moved from apparent quiescence to active revolt. The question is particularly acute for Syria, where the Asad regime has ruled not simply through coercion, but also by enforcing a culture of everyday cynicism. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Aleppo in 2008-9, I argue that everyday Syrian narratives that lament or scorn the self are a way of radically identifying oneself with a contemptible situation, and inviting that fact to be witnessed and empathized with. I term the radical identification enacted in these narratives 'involvement'. In order to understand why these narratives do not merely reproduce a cynical political culture in the same way that private mockery of the regime does, I propose a model of agency that develops the theme of authentic voice. I argue that the self-scorning voice sounds authentically through the combined agency of the involved subject and the empathetic witness. By enacting involvement, narratives that scorn and lament the self defy the culture of political cynicism and prepare the ground for revolt.

Cultural identity and social media in the Arab spring: Collective goals in the use of Facebook in the Libyan context,2013,"While the use of social media in articulating citizens’ actions and social change in the Arab Spring movement has challenged more traditional participation and public deliberation practices, important questions are emerging about the potential of the networked sphere to contribute to the democratic process in these countries. This article aims to analyse the role of cultural identity in facilitating civic participation and empowering citizens through the use of Facebook in the Libyan context. A content analysis of posts within three months in 2012 on three Libyan Facebook pages is performed in order to identify collective goals shared among the participants and their use of Facebook in reference to these objectives. The results reveal that new cultural values based on human rights and political freedom, in particular participation in free elections, are disseminated via Facebook, highlighting Libya’s transition from an authoritarian regime towards democracy. Second, Facebook is used to serve these collective goals through promoting civic journalism, encouraging freedom of speech and facilitating participation in civic and political activities. Facebook also supports among Libyan citizens an inclusive discourse which recognizes equal representation of all regions in the country and its cultural and political significance in the emergence of a new democracy.

Enacting entrepreneurship in 'informal' businesses,2013,"The objective of this paper is to establish whether informal firms have entrepreneurial possibilities, or are marginal and inconsequential. The authors explore the nature of informal entrepreneurship in the theoretically rich context of Tunisia where, in the turbulent aftermath of the Arab Spring, the fiercely competitive environment is characterized by high unemployment while informal enterprise flourishes. The authors critically examine concepts of push and pull, necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship, as used in some studies to 'explain' informal entrepreneurship as inferior. It is argued that these are descriptors and that it is wrong to ascribe causality to them with regard to the nature of businesses. Consequently, it is maintained that informal enterprises have been wrongly construed as dead-end, marginal small businesses with no entrepreneurial future. The paper presents a comparative case analysis of three informal and three formal firms, using the framework of entrepreneurial orientation. The authors find that, although their nature does affect size and growth, informal enterprises are entrepreneurial. Moreover, when viewed more broadly, these businesses are but a different form of entrepreneurship. Their entrepreneurial 'fit' is in the opportunity created by their context and circumstances. It is therefore conceptually wrong to dismiss them as marginal, but practically right to seek out ways to bring them into the formal sector.","Enacting entrepreneurship in 'informal' businesses The objective of this paper is to establish whether informal firms have entrepreneurial possibilities, or are marginal and inconsequential.

"Libyan constitutionality and sovereignty post-Qadhafi: the Islamist, regionalist, and Amazigh challenges",2013,"Since the overthrow of Muammar Qadhafi, Libya's political and security institutions have suffered from a power vacuum. The interim governments' absence of 'real power' has been mirrored by their corresponding absence of 'abstract authority'. Both dynamics are indicative of an ongoing struggle over what constitutes sovereign, legitimate authority in post-Qadhafi Libya. From the National Transitional Council's (NTC's) inception until its handover of power, it claimed to possess 'temporary' sovereign authority - sufficient to administer Libya and define the rules of the post-Qadhafi transitional phase. Throughout the protracted constitutional drafting process, the country has been 'governed' according to the Temporary Constitutional Declaration (TCD) issued by the NTC in August 2011. Amendments to - and popular contestation of - the TCD have constrained Libya's political evolution, impeded the constitutional drafting process, and impinged upon the legitimacy of the General National Congress (GNC)- the NTC's successor body. This article will illustrate how and why the TCD was contested by Islamists, federalists, and certain Berber groups. Our use of copious Arabic primary source material allows the views of these groups to be presented in their own words. The NTC's responses to its challengers reveal a distinct pattern: it attempted to incorporate Islamists into its framework, it appeased Cyrenaican federalists, and it ignored the grievances of Berber activists. The implications of this highly unbalanced strategy remain at the core of Libya's present instability and the GNC's inability to stand up against its myriad challengers.

"ICT, Social Media, and the Arab Transition to Democracy: From Venting to Acting",2013,"There is widespread use of information and communications technology (ICT) in the Middle East and North African countries. Blogging and social media have played an important role in the recent calls for reform and change. Using these new communication systems and devices, citizens have been venting their anger and frustration with their autocratic governments and rulers. Most recently, the venting has turned into action, as shown by the eradication of the old regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen, as well as the ongoing struggle in Syria. The most notable issues include lack of individual freedoms, deteriorating economic conditions, high unemployment, increased corruption, and violent treatment of citizens at the hands of security forces. The Arab Spring, or Awakening, and the events that have since followed have, in part, been promoted by ICT and other means of modern communications. Along with the popular Arab traditions of oral communication as well as Friday and Sunday sermons at mosques and churches, social media were used by organizers of the Arab Spring to call for and coordinate demonstrations against the regimes. Access to this newer media has circumvented the established and government-controlled media such as printed press, radio, and television—outlets bent on appeasing the rulers and misinforming the masses. Arab authoritarian systems have discovered that they cannot simply flip a big red switch to stop the flow of information that they would rather keep hidden from the masses. Further discussed are digital democracies that are currently emerging because of the growing population of netizens, bloggers, and social media political activists throughout the Arab world and the many attempts to silence them.

Christian–Muslim Relations in Egypt in the Wake of the Arab Spring,2013,"The Arab Spring protests that brought massive and largely unforeseen political change to Egypt included all sectors of society, including the Egyptian Christian population, known as Copts. Copts participated in large numbers in the protests that brought about regime change in February 2011, but the broader implications of the revolution to Copts are unclear. In this essay, I address the changes in Christian–Muslim relations that attended the development of a new republican regime in Egypt as a result of the Arab Spring. While the former regime of President Hosni Mubarak had formed a stable elite partnership with the hierarchy of the Coptic Orthodox Church (a “neo-millet” system), the 2011 revolution contributed to the erosion of this partnership in favor of a republican and pluralist model of citizenship in which individual Copts represent their own interests. The increasingly assertive public role of lay movements among Copts, coupled with the death of the Coptic Patriarch (pope) and his replacement by a younger successor, points to the continued erosion of the elite partnership in favor of the new model. Time will tell whether or not pluralist representation or a retrenched corporatism that favors the church will dominate Christian–Muslim relations in Egypt into the future.

The Prefigurative Politics of Tahrir Square-An Alternative Perspective on the 2011 Revolutions,2013,"Only one year after the global wave of protest movements and revolts-starting with the 'Arab Spring', then, subsequently, the Indignados movement and Occupy- our appreciation of such movements turned sour. The aim of this contribution is to question the predominantly sceptical and defeatist discourse on these movements. One element central to many defeatist discourses on the 2011 movements, is the way in which a lack of demonstrable 'outcomes' or 'successes' is retrospectively ascribed to them. Therefore, an alternative approach should be formulated, which would allow us to recognise the significant or valuable aspects of these movements and their practices, without downplaying them as 'unsuccessful' or 'failures' altogether. Pierre Rosanvallon's concept of 'counter-democracy' and Hardt and Negri's perspective of a 'Multitude' will be evaluated as alternative approaches to current political movements. Although they are meritorious, both perspectives do not go far enough and need further articulation. The notion of 'prefiguration', originally derived from contemporary anarchist discourse, could be beneficial to this endeavour. After defining and deepening this concept from an anarchist perspective, it will be applied to one particular context: the occupation of Tahrir Square in Cairo, during the 2011 revolution in Egypt. As will be concluded, in its application this concept of 'prefiguration' could teach us more about the recent wave of protest movements in general, and could help us to formulate a different approach to such movements.

Rather, it was motivated by a pattern of amity and enmity inherited from the Cold War period. The surprising survival of this pattern was due to the three authoritarian regimes' inability to reform; to the ensuing preservation of their Cold War era perception in the West; and to Russia's new availability as an external patron. Consequently, the article argues that the Arab Spring can be perceived as the last, belated episode of the Cold War. However, its political consequences put an end to the last features inherited from the pre-1989 period and open a new Middle Eastern era.

Earlier representations of the success of authoritarianism in the Middle East and North Africa generated common misperceptions concerning politically effective behaviour in the region. These views, shared by local autocrats and international actors alike, led them to propose ad hoc policy reorientations in response to a contagion of popular uprisings. In their turn, these policy responses directly contributed to the failure of authoritarianism and the production of democratic revolutions in several countries of the region. Such revolutionary options, although structured by the (lack of) opportunities for contestation present in each polity, are not predicable events as they depend on elite mis-assessments of the situation to be effective (as in Tunisia, Libya). Reciprocally, when reform pathways are made available by authoritarian regimes, contestation can be channelled into non-revolutionary political action (as in Morocco, Algeria).

We argue, however, that the EU's attempts at democracy promotion in the MENA region may be understood through a governmentality framework, despite the limitations of such an approach. Specifically, the EU is actively promoting neoliberal policies in the aftermath of the Arab Spring in order to foster a mode of subjectivity that is conducive to the EU's own norms and interests. What we observe are not just innocent attempts at democracy promotion, but a form of politics and economics that seeks to subject the agency on the 'Arab street' to EU standards. We conclude by going over the radical plurality of the Arab street, and show how it was in fact earlier neoliberal reforms by their former regimes that created the conditions of possibility for the recent revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt.

It is now understood that, despite the wide range of political and theological views contained within these, a shared understanding of Muslim history, methodological approaches, and preferred classical scholars characterizes most, if not all Salafi environments, regardless of their geographical locations. Ethnographically detailed, historically sensitive studies on Salafism have now been carried out in several countries. Strangely, despite the strong Salafi presence in Egypt's post-'Arab Spring' political landscape, Egypt is not one of these. At a time when the need to understand the workings of Salafism, in both local and transnational guises, seems increasingly urgent, this article pauses to ask why this process of reflection has taken so long to develop. Several concrete reasons for Western scholarship's apparent myopia in the context of Salafism, both general and specific to Egypt, are here identified. The article concludes by drawing attention to some of the potential benefits of incorporating Salafi ideas and figures into contemporary Western Middle Eastern Studies curriculae and research programs.","Egyptian Salafism as a problematic for islamic and Middle Eastern Studies The phenomenon of ""global Salafism,"" as distinct from ""Islamism,"" or ""Political Islam,"" was only recognized by Western scholars comparatively recently.

During summer 2011, Moroccan media renamed Tangiers: 'People's Capital of the 20 February Movement'; depicted as young and new, albeit heterogeneous in age, genre and of socio-political appurtenance. Furthermore, the last decade has witnessed populace protests throughout Morocco; particularly in small, medium-sized cities like Khouribga; emigration springboard towards Turin since the eighties.

My analysis shows how this sentiment - publicized during the Arab Spring, but rooted in Moroccan history - emigrates by accompanying people, who encounter growing migration-policy and life-condition difficulties in a new context. In conclusion, I will show how corporeity can transmute into a manipulatively exploitable power-element; culminating in individual and collective violence.

After a violent revolution: Romanian democratisation in the early 1990s,2013,"The 2011 uprisings in the Middle East have frequently been compared to the 1989 revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe. The prospects of free elections in countries such as Egypt, and Libya gave rise to concerns over the extent to which the regime change can be equated with the pursuit of a democratisation, in particular in the absence of a strong socio-economic integration programme at the regional level. Drawing on a social constructivist perspective, I present the Romanian experience in pursuing and complying with membership criteria for intergovernmental organisations (igos) and the approaches adopted by political decision-makers in the first five years of post-communist transformation. The lessons from this case study are two-fold: firstly, the willingness to manage inter-ethnic disputes remained primarily subsumed to political interests as long as no strong compels were imposed; secondly, the prospect of full membership in multilateral institutions served the purpose of domestic legitimacy even when there was only partial compliance with international norms, which delayed the implementation of a thorough reform process. Nonetheless, as different regional forums increased their leverage by employing threats of sanctions, the role of igos increasingly constrained domestic elites. In light of this, the democratisation efforts started after the Arab Spring could build on the experiences of regional cooperation initiatives as those initiated in the 1990s in Central and Eastern Europe.","After a violent revolution: Romanian democratisation in the early 1990s The 2011 uprisings in the Middle East have frequently been compared to the 1989 revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe.

The recent 'Arab Spring' uprisings further accentuated this complex role, given the partys support for every single popular resistance movement in the Arab world, with the exception of Syria, its major political ally in the region. This stark contradiction highlights once again the question of how far Hezbollah should be perceived as a proxy client of both Iran and Syria or whether it represents an intrinsic and genuine local resistance movement. In this article I argue that scholarly treatment of Hezbollah's nature, which has oscillated between structure-led, agency-led and dualistic types of analyses, is problematic.

This paper addresses the following problem: Under what conditions are authoritarian regimes able to disrupt Internet traffic in situations of a popular uprising, and what can be done to prevent it? We illustrate that there are three critical variables in this interaction: redundancy in communications, distribution of power across organizations and individuals and geographic localities, and state regulation. We argue for a more resilient, redundant network. We propose policies that can be implemented in more open states with greater influence on the development of the network. We illustrate that the same investments that empower dissidents actually strengthen the Internet for commerce and government, and against unauthorized attacks.","Protecting the internet from dictators: Technical and policy solutions to ensure online freedoms In this paper we explore the interaction between Internet communications, activists, and the state in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Uganda and northern Sudan.

Pious Way to Politics: The Rise of Political Salafism in Post-Mubarak Egypt,2013,"The Arab Spring has reshaped the Islamist landscape in the Middle East drastically. After decades of repression and exclusion, Islamist parties have taken power in Egypt, Tunis, and Morocco. However, the startling rise of Salafism (Salafiyya) remains the most visible feature of the new Islamist scene in the region. After decades of eschewing politics for theological and political reasons, Salafi movements and groups have rushed into electoral politics enthusiastically. They became keen to form political parties, contest elections, and vie for power. In Egypt, the Salafi parties fared well in the post-revolution parliamentary elections and are a key player in drafting Egypt's new constitution. This article explores the rise of Salafism after Mubarak and examines its effects on the democratic transition in Egypt. It investigates the ideological and theological stance of Salafi movements and parties on politics and democracy in particular. The argument put forward is that the extraordinary political openness in Egypt after the revolution has pushed Salafis into everyday politics. Subsequently, Salafis have become more inclined to adopt a pragmatic and practical discourse. Based on field research, this article provides a thematic analysis of Egyptian Salafism and assesses its political future.

From indignation to occupation: A new wave of global mobilization,2013,"The present monograph issue focuses on the 2011-2012 global wave of protests that began in Tunisia in 2011. This introductory article notes that two streams of mobilization can be distinguished in terms of the specific grievances they express, and the socioeconomic and political contexts in which they have emerged. The article argues, however, that despite these differences both threads find their antecedents in the increasing and widespread social and economic levels of inequality, which requires social movements theories to 'bring political economy back' in the analysis of mobilization. It is further argued that the various occupy movements that have emerged since 2011 constitute diverse manifestations of a new international cycle of contention. With its innovative and distinctive traits in terms of diffusion, coordination, action repertoires, frames, and types of activism, this new cycle seeks to both transform the economic system to provide greater equality, opportunities, and personal fulfillment and, simultaneously, to democratize power in more participatory ways.

Casting off the shackles of Libya's Arab-Middle Eastern foreign policy: A unique case of rapprochement with non-Arab Turkey (1970s-2011),2013,"This study offers an analysis of one of the lesser-known chapters in Libya's foreign policy under the Qaddafi regime, and focuses on Libyan-Turkish relations. The study shows that during most of the era of collaboration, spanning the period of mid-1970s-2011, Libya's relations with Turkey constituted an exceptional 'island' of pragmatism in Libya's ocean of fanatically and ideologically driven foreign relations. Often plagued by Qaddafi's tumultuous political and ideological whims, as a result of which he often entangled his country in military adventures and conflicts, the study explores the unique nature of Tripoli-Ankara ties, notwithstanding Turkey's Western orientation and amicable links with Israel (at least during the major part of the period reviewed) - both perceived by Qaddafi as pure evil. Tripoli carefully navigated its ties with Ankara, with the exception of the crisis Qaddafi provoked in 1996 when he let his staunchly ideological support of the Kurdish cause eclipse and shake the rational Libyan-Turkish relations. Examining this set of bilateral ties mainly through a Libyan prism, the article also sheds light on the major Turkish crossroads on the bilateral track. Tracing these relations, which flourished mainly within an economic context, the discussion takes into account the two countries' domestic affairs as well as their wider regional and international environs - all of which impacted the convergence or conflict of interests.

However, social and political changes taking place throughout Egypt and the Arab region reflect a shift. In a country like Egypt, where only around 30 % of the population have internet access, the vibrant digital media scene is relocating itself once more in public spaces. Digital initiatives, such as Askar Kadhibun (Lying generals) and Musirrin (Steadfast), are transforming online media material into older (pre-modern) modes of traditional media, such as graffiti and traveling street performances. This constitutes a shift towards the ascendancy of popular cultural production, and a challenge to the reification and sacrilization of digital media in a context where poverty and illiteracy play a major role in both the dissemination of information and in political mobilization.

However, two years after the start of these uprisings, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya are still in a state of crisis, even though new leaders have been elected into power. Thus, to contribute to the early detection of similar uprisings, their prevention and resolution, this article refocuses discourse and policy decisions about the Arab Spring back to the original demands of the protestors and to its root causes, namely the demand for improved lives.

American policymakers quickly came to regard the Libyan revolution as anathema after Qaddafi expropriated U.S. oil companies and forced the Pentagon to relinquish its air base outside Tripoli. Misinterpreting the new regime's increasingly radical nationalism as evidence of Soviet subversion and failing to appreciate the broad appeal of resurgent Islam, the Nixon and Ford administrations froze arms sales to Libya and provided covert support for anti-Qaddafi forces. After Jimmy Carter's bid to improve relations with Libya backfired, tensions escalated dramatically during the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan branded Qaddafi as a terrorist and a Soviet stooge and unleashed the Sixth Fleet and the CIA in an unsuccessful bid to effect regime change in Libya that was punctuated by the U.S. air raid on Tripoli in April 1986. Qaddafi's erratic behavior and his supersized ego, of course, always made dealing with him a diplomatic nightmare, but the blend of covert action and gunboat diplomacy that Nixon preferred and that Reagan perfected only made a bad situation worse.

The end of neoliberalism? An institutional analysis of the arab uprisings,2013,"The 1980s economic crises in Egypt and Tunisia ushered in the neoliberal economic austerity era, rampant corruption, increased inequality, and socio-economic exclusion. At the same time, it also built a multi-billion-dollar business empire for the elite class connected to the presidential palace. The increasingly arrogant and violent oppression by the state security apparatus ultimately sparked the revolutionary slogans demanding ""freedom, jobs, and dignity."" This paper argues that little progress has been made to satisfy those demands because the transition governments (and opposition parties) have failed to put forward an alternative economic program to remedy the negative economic consequences of neoliberalism. Focusing exclusively on Tunisia and Egypt, this paper uncovers the neoliberal roots of economic inequality and socio-economic exclusion that have led to the uprisings. It further suggests that the original institutionalist theory of institutional adjustment provides the most adequate framework for achieving the ultimate goals of the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings. Finally, this paper concludes by outlining the institutional prerequisites for a successful transition to a post-neoliberal system in Tunisia and Egypt. ","The end of neoliberalism?

Nation as neighborhood: How Bab al-Hara dramatized Syrian identity,2013,"This article discusses a popular Syrian television drama series, Bab al-Hara (The Neighborhood Gate), which ran for five seasons (2006-10). It is part of a genre of television series called the ""Damascene milieu,"" which nostalgically dramatizes life in imagined Damascene neighborhoods in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. The narrative of Bab al-Hara focuses on how a Syrian community lived under and resisted French colonial rule and its local collaborators. The article argues that the strategic imagination of the past in the series reflects the Syrian regime's project of national consolidation in Syria, a country sharply divided by class, sect, and local belonging and desperately seeking to bridge a gap between state authority and a national sense of belonging. However, within the context of the 2011 uprising, both regime and opposition discourses echoed themes and symbols from the series - demonstrating its political relevance. The article concludes that the series is a spectacular example of how popular culture, particularly in postcolonial and authoritarian contexts, contributes to the imagination of identity and memory in ways that are used by different national groups to bolster and contest political positions.

Twilight of 'state capitalism' in formerly 'socialist' Arab states,2013,"During the 1950s and 1960s, Egypt and Syria were characterised as 'state capitalist'. The main pillars of these socioeconomic structures were radical land reform, far-reaching nationalisation, and heavy-handed state intervention. During the 'state capitalist' period, the Egyptian and Syrian states took upon themselves the challenge of initiating an internally induced and independent path to economic development, mitigating foreign dominance, and alleviating the economic impediments that existed during the post-colonial period. By controlling the means of production through its tight control of the state apparatus, the state capitalist class in either country assumed the role of the agent of investment. It also promoted state-led and import-substituting investment that, on the one hand, built the economy's productive capacity and, on the other hand, promoted developmental and socially responsible outcomes. Nevertheless, since the working class did not assume political representation and participation in the new state apparatus, the whole process of egalitarian development was gradually reversed in the subsequent period. As of the early 1970s, the state capitalist class in both Egypt and Syria introduced market-friendly economic reforms that paved the way for the socioeconomic structure to transform from 'state capitalism' to private capitalism. This article seeks to explore the twilight of 'state capitalism' in the subsequent period of economic liberalisation and the accompanying reversal of socially responsible economic policies. By adopting a political economy approach, it considers economic, social, and political factors that explain the reasons behind this transformation, in general, and the change in the social alliance of the state capitalist class that shaped a new agent of investment, in particular. With the certitude of hindsight, this article argues that the market-friendly economic reforms generated anti-developmental outcomes that aggravated social hardships and inevitably ignited the political uprisings in 2011. This article concludes that there is much to gain, in both economic and social terms, from reverting to the previous macroeconomic strategies enacted during the 'state capitalist' period.

This article reviews the investigation of Lebanon's 2004-2008 string of assassinations, a novel international venture precipitated by the February 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri. It argues that shifting realist and idealist impulses on the international level, alongside a vicious struggle in Lebanon, allowed the intrusion of international justice in the form of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), although with meager results up to late 2012.

Turkey's changing foreign policy and the Arab spring,2013,"This paper inquires about Turkey's foreign policy towards its neighbors in the recent decade as related to the Arab Spring. The Turkish government, under the Justice and Development Party, has followed an ""idealistic"" foreign policy called ""zero problems with neighbors"" as an important component of its ""strategic depth"" approach to Turkey's foreign policy. Hence, it has improved relations with almost all its neighbors, excluding some remaining issues with Armenia, Cyprus (Greek), and Greece. An outcome of this policy was that Assad's government in Syria and the Turkish government signed multilevel cooperation agreements and held joint cabinet meetings. Until the arrival of the Arab Spring, the two countries' relations were becoming closer. In 2011, Turkey gradually started to promote change in the Middle East, and supported oppositions against the authoritarian regimes of Tunisia and Egypt, and then against Qaddafi and finally against the Syrian regime. The Turkish government, based on its good relations with the Syrian government, first tried to persuade/push Assad to start a comprehensive reform program, accommodating the demands of the opposition. After Assad's resistance to such reforms, the relations between the two governments deteriorated quickly. The crisis has also become a subject of interstate rivalry among regional powers, including Turkey. The Syrian crisis created a bigger challenge for Turkish foreign policy because its relations with Iran and Russia, which supported the Assad regime, were negatively affected by the crisis. In addition, the main opposition party in Turkey heavily criticized the government's foreign policy approach, as it saw Turkey's involvement in the Syrian crisis as a foreign policy failure. This paper discusses the domestic and international causes of Turkey's foreign policy approach and how the Arab Spring and subsequent Syrian crisis affected Turkish foreign policy toward the region.","Turkey's changing foreign policy and the Arab spring This paper inquires about Turkey's foreign policy towards its neighbors in the recent decade as related to the Arab Spring.

Notes from the field: Silence kills! Women and the transitional justice process in post-revolutionary Tunisia,2013,"This article is based on the first collection of testimonies of female former political prisoners in Tunisia. Relying on purposive rather than random sampling, the interviews were aimed at contributing to an authentic Tunisian process of transitional justice that takes cultural, religious and gender-based norms into consideration. To date, the voices of conservative Islamist women detained under the Tunisian dictatorship have been significantly absent from the national discourse on transitional justice. Select voices of women are presented here that can begin to address this gap. The newly elected provisional government, in which the Islamist Ennahda Party enjoys a majority, has established a Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, the first of its kind in the world. While this augurs well for Tunisia's future, there is fear that the transitional justice process may nonetheless be captured by political agendas.","Notes from the field: Silence kills!

The impact of corruption on FDI: Is MENA an exception?,2013,"The eruption of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt was ensued by deterioration in FDI inflows. Whether a new Middle East free of corruption accompanying previous dictatorships will offset the negative ramifications of the uprisings and enhance FDI in the long run remains debatable. Since the evidence on the causal relationship between corruption and FDI is inconclusive, this study attempts to take another step. The paper investigates the link between corruption and FDI flows to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and assesses whether or not corruption has more importance than other FDI determinants. By employing several panel settings with various econometric specifications on 21 MENA countries over the period 2003 to 2009, it is demonstrated that FDI varies positively with corruption. Additionally, FDI in MENA was found to vary positively with per capita income, openness, freedom and security of investments and negatively with the tax and homicide rates. Since corruption was not found to hinder FDI inflows, treating corruption should be based on sound legal procedures that infringe neither on the rights, freedom and security of FDI nor on the degree of openness and freedom of the economy, which are the real stimulants of FDI in MENA.

Relationship between state and religion: Egypt after the revolution,2013,"According to Tariq Al-Bishri, it is not true that it is the Islamic current that controls the state in Egypt as a political project is in the process of crystallizing. His main proposal is for the three forces dominating the structure and dynamics of political life in Egypt - namely the army and judiciary, the Muslim Brotherhood, and liberals - to collaborate and avoid posing religion and the state as two opposing entities. Having to deal with the Shari'a as the source or reference for legislation need not be a polarizing issue as religion is being dealt with as 'the dominant culture'; moreover, much work has already been done along this line throughout the 20th century. Al-Bishri argues that democracy within a society becomes vacuous if it is detached from solving its socio-economic challenges. To this end he prioritizes four main issues: (1) freeing the Egyptian national will from American and Israeli pressures; (2) reforming and rebuilding government administrative bureaucracy; (3) organizing civil society; and (4) drafting a constitution. Al-Bishri considers that 'after Islamists assume power in Egypt' it is imperative for the existing political and cultural forces in Egypt to cooperate as none of them has enough power to negate the others or lead on his own.

Emotions and the microfoundations of the Arab uprisings,2013,"In any political setting, a few people will defy political authority. The main challenge for theories of rebellion is to explain when and why others join en masse. Scholarship on social movements typically develops answers to this puzzle on the basis of either of two microfoundations. Explanations that conceptualize individuals as utility-maximizers contend that they protest as a means to other ends. Explanations that see individuals as driven by values and beliefs suggest that people protest for the inherent benefit of voicing dissent. Both perspectives generate compelling explanations. Yet how do purposeful individuals act when utilitarian calculations and cherished values recommend contrary courses of action? Why might an actor prioritize one or the other at different points in time? Taking on these questions, I argue for an approach to microfoundations that focuses on emotions. Emotions such as fear, sadness, and shame promote pessimistic assessments, risk aversion, and a low sense of control. Such dispiriting emotions encourage individuals to prioritize security and resign to political circumstances, even when they contradict values of dignity. By contrast, anger, joy, and pride promote optimistic assessments, risk acceptance, and feelings of personal efficacy. Such emboldening emotions encourage prioritization of dignity and increase willingness to engage in resistance, even when it jeopardizes security. When instrumentality and values offer different answers to the question of whether to resign or rebel, therefore, emotions can shift individuals toward one or the other. I ground this argument in findings from the neurosciences and illustrate it with evidence from the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the absence of an uprising in Algeria.

"Mutiny and nonviolence in the Arab Spring: Exploring military defections and loyalty in Egypt, Bahrain, and Syria",2013,"Recent studies of civil resistance indicate that security force defections can heavily influence the outcome of nonviolent uprisings against authoritarian regimes. Yet we know little about why, when, and how mutiny occurs. In this article, I ask: what factors influence the likelihood of military defections during a nonviolent conflict? In reviewing various literatures, I identify ten factors that facilitate or obstruct mutiny. I propose that two of these are particularly influential: (1) whether troops receive economic or political benefits from the regime; and (2) whether troops perceive the regime as fragile, based on the international community's response to the conflict. Specifically, I argue that troops who receive benefits from a regime are more likely to remain loyal while those who receive no such benefits are more likely to defect. However, even the most underprivileged troops are unlikely to defect if they believe that the state is strong enough to withstand a major civilian uprising. Soldiers' perception of regime strength is partly shaped by whether outside nations support the opposition, thereby weakening the state, or send troops to reinforce the regime's control. Using a qualitative comparative method, I illustrate these dynamics through an examination of several Arab Spring uprisings: Egypt, where the military sided with civil resisters; Bahrain, where troops remained loyal to the state; and Syria, where the military split. Then, to encourage more research on this topic, I use these three cases to generate additional hypotheses about defections that others can test against a wider set of cases. I conclude with a discussion of the questions that future researchers should explore and the types of methodological approaches that are needed in this field of study.

Instead most cyber-utopians stuck to a populist account of how technology empowers the people, who, oppressed by years of authoritarian rule, will inevitably rebel, mobilizing themselves through text messages, Facebook, Twitter, and whatever new tool comes along next year.2The above statements seem to suggest that the Internet is a space for contestation between freedom and security, but, for Morozov, in that contestation it is the forces of security, for regulation and control of the Internet which may be gaining the upper hand. (cf. Mueller3) The primary aim of this article is to consider ways in which a Netizen culture of free and open internet is constrained by forces of state surveillance and control. The developments in the Middle East provide one example of the apparent relationship of contestation between oppressive states and freedom-seeking cyber-citizens or Netizens within cyberspace's complex plural network modes of governance. The article compares Middle Eastern developments with developments elsewhere, particularly in China and the United States. It suggests that the relationship between Netizens and states needs to be understood in the context of the culture of the internet and modes of governance that involve complex networking among Netizen groups, commercial providers, governments and international institutions. Only through such a contextual examination of the complex interactions is it possible to understand the power (im)balances that provide the continuing tensions of global network information society. There have been many claims that the Arab spring was an Internet event. Egyptian security personnel cut off almost all access to the Internet other than to the stock exchange.4 Yet this did not stop the filling of Tahrir Square and ultimately the end of Mubarak. Some attributed this to the 'mosque net' as the traditional channel of communication, others have extolled the role of the more traditional medium of television and especially the new El Jezira.5 Some have focused on the role played by collaboration between social network sites, for example enabling Google and Twitter to allow people in Egypt to send Twitter messages by leaving a voicemail on a specific phone number.6 The Google executive Wael Ghoneim became an internet hero of the revolution through coordinating a crucial Facebook page.7 Global Cybercitizen organisations such as the Electronic Freedom Frontier had already been urging social network sites such as Facebook to take technical steps that would ensure the privacy of web users in countries with heavy internet surveillance.8.

Some attributed this to the 'mosque net' as the traditional channel of communication, others have extolled the role of the more traditional medium of television and especially the new El Jezira.5 Some have focused on the role played by collaboration between social network sites, for example enabling Google and Twitter to allow people in Egypt to send Twitter messages by leaving a voicemail on a specific phone number.6 The Google executive Wael Ghoneim became an internet hero of the revolution through coordinating a crucial Facebook page.7 Global Cybercitizen organisations such as the Electronic Freedom Frontier had already been urging social network sites such as Facebook to take technical steps that would ensure the privacy of web users in countries with heavy internet surveillance.8.

Democratic paradoxes: Women's rights and democratization in Kuwait,2013,"The 1999 decree by Kuwait's emir granting women electoral rights, and its subsequent parliamentary rejection, is more than just an instance of women's oppression in action. It also demonstrates a potential paradox between two axes of democratization: liberalization, the existence of a sphere of meaningful public contestation, and participation, that the right to participate in that sphere is extended to all. In Kuwait, 1999 represents an instance where those two axes were in direct competition. This article explores the 1999 enfranchisement as a way of understanding this democratic paradox and then follows these issues through the successful 2005 enfranchisement and the election of female Assembly members in 2007 and in the 2012, post-Arab Spring elections.

The Kurdish Spring,2013,"The purpose of this article is to survey the Kurdish Spring (demands for meaningful democracy along with cultural, social, and political rights and their immediate implementation) that has occurred in the aftermath of the much better known Arab Spring which began in late 2010. To this end it analyses the situation in Turkey, Iraq and Syria. In Turkey the failure of the government's much heralded Kurdish Opening and the prospects for its renewal are investigated. This includes the continuing KCK arrests and sentencings that seem more a war on dissent than on terror. In Iraq the rise of the Gorran Party, anti-government demonstrations which occurred in 2011, and Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) president Massoud Barzani's recent hints that the KRG will declare independence are discussed. The failure to agree on a hydrocarbons law and on a boundary for the KRG are two major reasons for Barzani's position. For Syria the article analyses the assassination of Mishaal Tammo in October 2011 and the rise of the PKK-affiliated PYD against the background of Syria suddenly becoming a major factor in the Kurdish Spring. Iran's relative quiescence will also be noted.

Energy transition and revolution in Tunisia: Politics and spatiality,2013,"Energy transition in Arab countries is usually addressed as an economic and technological issue. This analysis of Tunisian policies on renewable energy argues that it must be understood from a political and geographical perspective. Energy policy in Tunisia is dominated by STEG, the national utility for electricity and gas, which has held a monopoly since independence and enjoys strong historical legitimacy for its achievements. Beginning the 2000s, however, national energy self-sufficiency was challenged and the government pushed for renewable technologies, which STEG was wary of and whose implementation it has slowed. The Tunisian revolution has strongly shaken the balance of power in the country, allowing for multiple and multi-level criticisms of STEG and for the forging of new alliances for renewable energy projects. Some of these projects are on the verge of implementation. Because they rely on different geographical visions and varied technologies, however, they may in the end prove unevenly successful.

I argue that the changing interests of the middle class would have to be a central aspect of a coherent story, on accounts of both distributional and modernization considerations, and that the ongoing transformation can be best understood in terms of their defection from the autocratic order to a new democratic order, which is still in formation. I then review what the evidence says in two central parts of the emerging narrative, for the case of Egypt: first, by looking directly at changes in opinion and asking whether these are consistent with the predictions of the theory. And second, by examining the corporate sector before and during the uprisings of 2011 in order to understand better the performance of “crony capitalism”, and to evaluate whether it may have affected the incentives of the middle class to defect.

It examines the literature on Islamist moderation prior to the Arab uprisings and asks whether the central tenets of those arguments hold in the dynamic environments of the post-revolutionary contexts, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, where Islamists have done well in free and fair elections. I argue that in unstable and changing institutional contexts, the logic of the inclusion-moderation hypothesis is less likely to be present, particularly when more extreme opposition groups challenge Islamists to prove their core commitment to a conservative religious political vision.

Unrest and state response in Arab monarchies,2013,"The Arab Spring in the monarchies has ranged from a virtual nonevent in the UAE to large-scale and often violent protests aiming to overthrow the regime in Bahrain. Correspondingly, the gamut of state responses ran from tactical-preemptive political concessions in Qatar to the armed suppression of the uprising in Bahrain. The Arab monarchies have been classified in several ways, based on their historical traditions, religious authority, state-building capacity, and natural-resource endowment. For the purpose of explaining political outcomes, the most useful typology distinguishes between dynastic and linchpin monarchies. In dynastic monarchies, male members of the ruling families tend to dominate the top political offices, are actively involved in the daily management of state bureaucracies, and often compete with one another for influence.

"From one shore, the other. the image of france in the works of contemporary judeo-maghrebi novelists",2013,"The specific ""Idea of France,"" as expressed by French authors of Jewish-Maghrebi origin, comes from the conflicted relationship they have with the concept.

They remember the French revolution, the Crémieux decree of 1870, and their education in republican schools in Algeria or at the Alliance Israélite Universelle in Tunisia or in Morocco, which only reinforces the idea. Their narratives express many echoes of this shared history, where France is exalted for having brought these emancipatory values. Nonetheless, their image of France is tarnished by three striking events: the fact that Algerian Jews were stripped of their French nationality in 1940, the exile en masse from North Africa when France left her colonies and protectorates, and the difficult time they had getting established in the metropole. Given the particular history of North African Jews, this literature is surely a rare example of a bittersweet relationship to an adopted homeland.

Y-Chromosome and mtDNA Genetics Reveal Significant Contrasts in Affinities of Modern Middle Eastern Populations with European and African Populations,2013,"The Middle East was a funnel of human expansion out of Africa, a staging area for the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, and the home to some of the earliest world empires. Post LGM expansions into the region and subsequent population movements created a striking genetic mosaic with distinct sex-based genetic differentiation. While prior studies have examined the mtDNA and Y-chromosome contrast in focal populations in the Middle East, none have undertaken a broad-spectrum survey including North and sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and Middle Eastern populations. In this study 5,174 mtDNA and 4,658 Y-chromosome samples were investigated using PCA, MDS, mean-linkage clustering, AMOVA, and Fisher exact tests of FST's, RST's, and haplogroup frequencies. Geographic differentiation in affinities of Middle Eastern populations with Africa and Europe showed distinct contrasts between mtDNA and Y-chromosome data. Specifically, Lebanon's mtDNA shows a very strong association to Europe, while Yemen shows very strong affinity with Egypt and North and East Africa. Previous Y-chromosome results showed a Levantine coastal-inland contrast marked by J1 and J2, and a very strong North African component was evident throughout the Middle East. Neither of these patterns were observed in the mtDNA. While J2 has penetrated into Europe, the pattern of Y-chromosome diversity in Lebanon does not show the widespread affinities with Europe indicated by the mtDNA data. Lastly, while each population shows evidence of connections with expansions that now define the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, many of the populations in the Middle East show distinctive mtDNA and Y-haplogroup characteristics that indicate long standing settlement with relatively little impact from and movement into other populations.

Using the Gramscian concept of hegemony, this paper examines the strategies deployed by subaltern groups in three Arab countries with comparable sociopolitical conditions: namely, Egypt, Syria, and Algeria. It contends that Egyptian protesters were successful in toppling their president because they were facing a weak hegemony while in Algeria people were unable to threaten the regime seriously since they confronted a strong hegemonic bloc. Furthermore, on a continuum from the most to the least hegemonic, the Syrian regime is situated midway between the two. The Syrian elite were not strong enough to implement a passive revolution comparable to the Algerian one, but they had sufficient cohesion to prevent a quick fragmentation similar to the one that the Egyptian ruling class experienced.

How Al Jazeera reported the Arab Spring: A preliminary comparative analysis,2013,"This article provides a preliminary analysis of the ways in which Al Jazeera’s interaction with alternative media practitioners and activists during the Arab Spring was represented both in their reportage and reporting by others. The article presents a comparative analysis of the ways that AJE, CNN and BBC interacted with alternative modes of journalistic practice during the initial days of the Arab Spring protests. Focusing on Egypt and Libya on six politically important days during the protests, this article will suggest that AJE’s coverage was more successful at integrating ‘amateur’ material into their reportage.

"David Harvey in Tahrir Square: The dispossessed, the discontented and the Egyptian revolution",2013,"Starting from the empirical distinction between 'discontented' and 'dispossessed' created by processes of accumulation by dispossession necessary for neoliberalism to succeed, this paper suggests how the broader historical-geographical framework developed by David Harvey helps us make sense of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. The paper focuses on the underlying tension between the ever more frequent encroachments of 'the molecular processes of capital accumulation in space and time' within the political sphere and the persisting relevance of forms of territorial government and governance for the success of capital accumulation itself. This seeming contradiction allows us to account both for the penetration of neoliberalism in Egypt and for the different forms of hybridisation and domestication that accompanied it. It suggests that, by looking at the social consequences of neoliberalism, one can see a sharp class polarisation, with the emergence of both a private capitalist oligarchy and embryonic forms of alliance between the dispossessed and the discontented, which had a central role in the 2011 revolution. This perspective also permits us to go beyond the dominant liberal narrative of the Arab Spring focusing on demands for freedom (horreya) and democracy (dimuqratya), recovering the neglected yet vital dimension of social justice ('adala igtimaya).

A secret field hospital organized by the medical Arab union was set in Al-Bab town in the district of Aleppo. Egyptian volunteer physicians were the operating team who reached Syria through the Turkish border. Medical supplies were delivered from Turkey and medical equipment were taken from the government hospital which was not running at that time. Many Syrian volunteers helped in running this field hospital most of them were non-medical personnel who were trained to help in some medical purposes. Total number of cases referred to the hospital was 75. Surgical intervention was needed for 28 patients. Most common procedures needed were vascular procedures (32 percent), orthopedic procedures (32 percent), and abdominal exploration (25 percent). Median injury severity score (ISS) for admitted patients were 21 with interquartile range (14-21). Two patients died intraoperatively due to massive bleeding. Setting up a field hospital in such an area with unsafe conditions needs good communication with medical and relief organizations in the site of crisis, selection of a location as near as possible to the Turkish border, developing a convenient triaging plan, and training nonmedical volunteers to do simple tasks.","Syrian revolution: a field hospital under attack.

Islamism(s) and the Arab uprisings: Between commanding the faithful and mobilising the protestor,2013,"This study attempts to situate Morocco within the recent Arab revolutions. The extant literature on Morocco's Islamism deems the 2003 Casablanca terrorist attacks a turning point in the Islamists' relationships with the regime on the one hand, and the public's view of political Islam on the other. However, with the recent protest movements, the regime can no longer sustain its security approach to Islamism. Further, and unlike the 2003 attacks, which made all Islamists prime suspects, the 2011 Marrakesh bombings brought the regime under further scrutiny by the protest movement. In the midst of the changes sweeping the Arab world, both the monarchial government and Islamists are facing a set of unknown parameters. It remains unclear whether the recent widening of dissent (to include liberals, women and minorities) would strengthen Islamism's presence in the Moroccan political scene. In order to call into question the trend deeming Islamism a recent phenomenon, this study aims to historicise Islamism in Morocco. So, an exploration of the origins, evolution and language of Islamism in Morocco is central to this study.

Art and the 'Arab Spring': Aesthetics of revolution in contemporary Tunisia,2013,"A striking proliferation of artwork has emerged in response to the Tunisian Revolution, following decades of censorship under the former president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, who was forced to flee the country on 14 January 2011.

However, many seek to avoid what the photographer Jellel Gasteli has dubbed '[des] icônes de l'exotisme révolutionnaire'. Drawing on postcolonial theory, this article argues that a still emerging corpus of artwork reveals an alternative 'aesthetic of resistance' with which to communicate the complexity and diversity of Tunisia. Such artwork forges a third way between totalising internal and external visions of the country. It presents a nuanced engagement with the Revolution, allowing - in distinctively visual or multisensorial ways - for 'untranslatable' voices or 'unrepresentable' visions of democracy in a universal sense.

Disarming Libya? A reassessment after the Arab Spring,2013,"In 2011, several months after a popular revolt overturned the Gaddafi regime in Libya, Libya's new National Transitional Council announced the discovery of what was later confirmed to be an undeclared stockpile of chemical weapons. This was a startling announcement to many observers, since Libya had publicly renounced its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes in 2003 and had apparently dismantled the programmes soon after. Although the Libyan case had repeatedly been referred to as a positive 'model' for nonproliferation-an instance where a country had voluntarily and peacefully rolled back its WMD programs-this recent discovery forces us to wonder whether the Libyan 'model' really was as successful as initially described. This article examines the successes, challenges and lessons that can be learned from the Libyan case of WMD renunciation and verification. As one model of cooperative verification, the Libyan case highlights not only the opportunities afforded by monitoring and verification regimes, but also some of the difficulties that any such regime will encounter in real-world circumstances, however positive.

Women were at the forefront of the demonstrations as protestors, medical workers, and aid providers, as well as organizing behind-the-scenes and in the diaspora, calling for political change and a just and inclusive transition to democracy. However, they have been systematically excluded from the public sphere facing intense de-politicization and silencing at a crucial moment in their national political transformation process. The Libyan revolution appears similar to other Arab revolutions in that it presents a ""gender paradox."" On the one hand, women are the politically empowered agents of the Revolution and change. On the other hand, they are the victims of a new kind of political violence and exclusion. Thus there is a need to address women's participation in the public sphere from a different approach than the usual ""women's empowerment."" The suggested approach is political and normative frameworks that are more inclusive, participatory, and integrated. Women's role should not be limited to defending women's issues or their formal numerical representation in decision-making bodies. Rather, women should struggle to become influential shapers of a new discourse of inclusion that rests upon inclusive state-building, gender-equitable institutional reform, inclusive social transformation, demilitarization and peace building.","Gender and state building in Libya: Towards a politics of inclusion The Libyan Revolution marks a watershed moment in Libyan history, and more specifically in the history of women's participation in the public space.

Supply chain risk management: The lessons learned from the Egyptian revolution 2011,2013,"This research investigates the impact of the Egyptian revolution on the supply chain (SC) of a number of companies in different business sectors for the purpose of evaluating the degree of their preparedness to SC risk. The study focuses on the three main components to a SC risk programme: (1) the ability to forecast/discover potential disruptions, (2) the ability to recover from the disruption, and (3) SC design strategies for resilience. The research is exploratory and descriptive in nature using semi-structured interviews for data collection. The sample of companies targeted in this study is of a purposive nature as the study focuses on a number of companies belonging to the manufacturing, retailing, and the transport and logistics sectors due to the direct impact they have on customers especially during turbulent economic and political situations. The main finding of this study is that supply chain risk management (SCRM) awareness is still poor in Egypt. Egyptian companies are strongly recommended to adapt SCRM by improving collaboration between the different departments/functions to analyse risks and to set the appropriate plans; and to fully understand their role as a vital link in the SCs of other companies.

Inside the iron cage of liberalism: International contexts and nonviolent success in the Iranian revolution,2012,"As recent events in the Middle East and North Africa suggest, nonviolent revolutionary movements may represent an oppressed population's most promising path to ridding itself of an authoritarian regime. But as the diverging experiences of Tunisia and Egypt on the one hand, and Libya, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen on the other suggest, nonviolent victory is never a foregone conclusion. This chapter seeks to contribute to our understanding of nonviolent revolutionary success through an analysis of one of the world's first nonviolent revolutions, that of Iran in 1977-1979. Based on historical evidence, I argue that friendly international relations between the United States and Iran is a key factor in explaining both the revolutionaries' preference for nonviolent tactics and the government's inability to repress the movement. Jimmy Carter's human rights framework served as an important incentive for revolutionaries to remain nonviolent while ensuring that state repression of unarmed protesters would come at a political price high enough to discourage the government from resorting to overwhelming violence.

Willed from the bottom up: The postcolonial turned revolutionary,2013,"'You must go back into history, that history of men damned by other men,' Frantz Fanon heralded half a century ago in The Wretched of the Earth, a revolutionary text par excellence. Until recently, the global context we all live in tried very hard to discredit both revolution and the possibility of revolution. And then came the 2011-Arab Spring, an event in the Alain Badiou sense of the word, a rupture that saw the mere suffering victim become the 'active, determining subject of judgment'. This suffering victim would fight to the death on behalf of the hapless multitude to claim his worthiness. Today, we set out to celebrate, commemorate, and reflect upon the event while thinking through The Wretched of the Earth, itself celebrating its golden anniversary. It is to its programme of complete disorder, in fact an overturning order, often against the odds, that we turn today to speak about how the national consciousness in the Arab world rose to claim radical change, a change where both the will in general and the general will of the people rejected once and for all the repressive collectivism that had trampled individual liberty for a long time. Indeed, it was in the name of 'dignity for all' that a will-in-the-making was born. In the process, it brought about an end to the passive, pathetic subjectivity of a whole people. I hope it is no exaggeration to say that nobody foresaw what was coming, not even the most enlightened of people at home or abroad. Indeed, on a dull, cold winter day, 14 January 2011, suddenly, the Tunisian people rose against tyranny. Shortly after, the event would pave the way for other uprisings in the Arab world, an Arab world thought to be incapable of aspiring to and achieving freedom. Still, the question remains: What made postcolonial Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, spearhead the first revolution of the twenty-first century? What were the causes beyond the socio-economic explanations, themselves insufficient for facing this crucial moment in history, when men and women exerted themselves to meet the challenge of toppling a coercive regime and emancipate themselves from mental and physical oppression? We must ponder the dimensions, both political and subjective, of this incredible tour de force in order to understand the reality on the ground. It is this double approach of 'ye are many, they are few' that I intend to privilege here. In the process, I will strive to answer the question: How can postcolonial men and women avoid falling to the level of 'victims' and seek to prove themselves as 'immortals'? It is in this sense that Mohammed Bouazizi and Co. are said to claim a new humanism.

Fragmentation in the Syrian opposition,2012,"The peaceful protests that erupted in the southern Syrian city of Dar'a in March 2011 sparked a protracted protest movement that has now entered its second year. These uprisings have been met with fierce repression by the regime, which has until recently rejected all regional and national demands for a halt to the violence, instead offering cosmetic political reforms, for example, in the form of a political parties law and a new constitution. Thus far, the regime has been able to shield itself from a more substantive political transition process in large part because of the absence of a unified Syrian opposition. Although the Syrian uprising has created the political opportunity for the formation of multiple Syrian opposition groups, they have, to date, been unsuccessful in uniting under one common organizational framework. Rather, as the uprising continues, more and more groups claiming to represent the opposition have emerged, creating disunity, conflict, and mistrust between the different opposition groups. In this paper, I ask the following question: What are the factors behind fragmentation in the Syrian opposition? Here, I make three claims. First, the presence of external and internal (inside/outside) opposition groups has impeded coordination among different political actors and the formation of a cohesive, organized framework for the mobilization of the opposition. The dynamics behind inside/outside divisions are complex, and include the lack of trust between different political actors and the inability of external based groups, such as the Syrian National Council (SNC), to affect political change on-the-ground. Following this latter point, the second claim made here is that the lack of popular representation among the protestors has contributed to fragmentation. This has created a legitimacy deficit that has multiple implications both domestically and internationally. On the one hand, their lack of popular representation has allowed the regime to avoid including these groups in a political transition process. On the other hand, this deficit has also prevented the international community from providing its full political and material support to the opposition. The legitimacy deficit is important to understanding fragmentation since it has discouraged opposition groups from centralizing their coordination. To some degree, the legitimacy deficit is a product of failed political strategies. The final claim advanced here concerns the competing political strategies of opposition groups. Opposition groups have been confronted with key strategic questions since the uprising began, including questions of violence or non-violence, negotiation with the regime or not, as well as whether to support military intervention. The political strategies adopted vis-a-vis these strategic questions have placed various opposition groups in tension with one another and have contributed to their fragmentation. The most obvious example here is of groups that emerged, such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), to exercise violence against the regime. These groups have caused major splits with those, such as the Local Coordination Committee (LCC), who advocate non-violence. Despite the political opportunity provided by the Syrian uprising, there remains no cohesive opposition. Rather, the opposition remains weak and fragmented. This fragmentation is reflected in the multiple splits between groups and the lack of coordination on key strategic issues. These divisions have negatively affected the possibilities for affecting political change in Syria and have worked to shield the regime from demands for a political transition process.","Fragmentation in the Syrian opposition The peaceful protests that erupted in the southern Syrian city of Dar'a in March 2011 sparked a protracted protest movement that has now entered its second year.

Although the Syrian uprising has created the political opportunity for the formation of multiple Syrian opposition groups, they have, to date, been unsuccessful in uniting under one common organizational framework. Rather, as the uprising continues, more and more groups claiming to represent the opposition have emerged, creating disunity, conflict, and mistrust between the different opposition groups. In this paper, I ask the following question: What are the factors behind fragmentation in the Syrian opposition? Here, I make three claims. First, the presence of external and internal (inside/outside) opposition groups has impeded coordination among different political actors and the formation of a cohesive, organized framework for the mobilization of the opposition. The dynamics behind inside/outside divisions are complex, and include the lack of trust between different political actors and the inability of external based groups, such as the Syrian National Council (SNC), to affect political change on-the-ground. Following this latter point, the second claim made here is that the lack of popular representation among the protestors has contributed to fragmentation. This has created a legitimacy deficit that has multiple implications both domestically and internationally. On the one hand, their lack of popular representation has allowed the regime to avoid including these groups in a political transition process. On the other hand, this deficit has also prevented the international community from providing its full political and material support to the opposition. The legitimacy deficit is important to understanding fragmentation since it has discouraged opposition groups from centralizing their coordination. To some degree, the legitimacy deficit is a product of failed political strategies. The final claim advanced here concerns the competing political strategies of opposition groups. Opposition groups have been confronted with key strategic questions since the uprising began, including questions of violence or non-violence, negotiation with the regime or not, as well as whether to support military intervention. The political strategies adopted vis-a-vis these strategic questions have placed various opposition groups in tension with one another and have contributed to their fragmentation. The most obvious example here is of groups that emerged, such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), to exercise violence against the regime. These groups have caused major splits with those, such as the Local Coordination Committee (LCC), who advocate non-violence. Despite the political opportunity provided by the Syrian uprising, there remains no cohesive opposition. Rather, the opposition remains weak and fragmented. This fragmentation is reflected in the multiple splits between groups and the lack of coordination on key strategic issues. These divisions have negatively affected the possibilities for affecting political change in Syria and have worked to shield the regime from demands for a political transition process.",['syr'],CW,False,True,False,3
Islamists and democracy: Cautions from Pakistan,2013,"Success in free elections held after the ""Arab Spring"" protests in Tunisia and Egypt has brought Islamists to power through democratic means, and Islamist influence is on the rise throughout the Arab world. Much of the debate about liberal democracy's future in Arab countries focuses on the extent to which the Islamists might be moderated by their inclusion in the democratic process. There is no doubt that the prospect of gaining a share of power through elections is a strong incentive that favors the tempering of extremist positions. But until the major Islamist movements give up their core ideology, their pursuit of an Islamic state is likely to impede their ability to be full and permanent participants in democratization. The real test of the Islamists' commitment to democracy will come not while they are in power for the first time, but when they lose subsequent elections.

Safety-valve elections and the arab spring: The weakening (and resurgence) of morocco's islamist opposition party,2013,"What purpose do elections serve in authoritarian states? Scholars often describe these elections as safety valves to contain opposition groups. Though we often use this safety valve terminology, it remains an abstract concept without sufficient empirical testing. In a study of the 2009 local elections in Morocco, I show how this safety-valve process played out in real politics. This article makes the case that the Moroccan regime undertook activities in an effort to weaken the Justice and Development Party (PJD), an Islamist opposition party. Using 20 original interviews and over 100 Arabic primary documents, I delineate the ways in which regime elites manipulated electoral rules and formal institutions, especially loyalist political parties, in an attempt to undermine the Islamists' power between 2007 and 2010. I also examine how Arab Spring unrest turned back many of these efforts, empowering the PJD to secure a sweeping victory in the 2011 parliamentary elections. I conclude by discussing how scholars may reconsider safety-valve elections in authoritarian regimes as sequenced processes rather than one-time events. This case study of Morocco generates a new theory of safety-valve elections testable in other contexts.

Revolutionary movements and De Facto Governments - Implications of the 'Arab Spring' for international investors,2012,"Recent events in the Middle East, such as the revolutions in Egypt and Libya and the civil war in Syria, have raised questions as to when a government is responsible for the acts of revolutionaries and when a revolutionary movement becomes a new government.

The Making of the Tunisian Revolution,2013,"The rapid fall of the Ben Ali regime in Tunisia on January 14, 2011 has not only sparked a wave of uprisings across the Arab region, but has also raised many questions about the rotes of socio-economic inequality, youth unemployment, corruption, and government oppression in the making of the Tunisian uprisings. This paper argues that what seemed to be an island of stability in the region was in fact a ticking time bomb that was set off by Mohamed Bouazizi in December 2010. It further argues that the overthrow of the Ben Ali regime could not have taken place had it not been a leaderless revolt. As a result, the paper provides a critical analysis of the making of the Tunisian revolution by investigating the key factors that maintained stability, and the mechanisms that set the stage for the uprisings. In doing so, the analysis reveals the radical social transformation that took place since the early 1990s leading to the breakdown of the social contract, and the gradual drift of the middle class away from its implicit support of the Ben Ali regime. The new political landscape opens up a real opportunity for democratic transformation, vibrant civic engagement, and sustainable economic revival. Therefore, our analysis would be incomplete without a careful look at the new dynamic between the forces of political Islam, secularism, and the middle class. Finally, the paper closes with a summary and some concluding remarks.

From casablanca to casanegra: Neoliberal globalization and disaffected youth in moroccan Urban cinema,2013,"This article deals with the two major actors in North Africa's 2011 uprisings-namely, youth and the city-through a critical exploration of the cinematic realism that has defined Moroccan filmmakers' response to the country's socioeconomic transformation under neoliberal globalization since the 1980s. Taking Noureddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) as a case study, I argue that this aesthetic frame discloses the critical potential of everyday life and the ordinary affects of anger and the will to revolt among Casablanca's youth today. This acclaimed film further allows us to approach Moroccan cinema's affective realism within an urban landscape in a country that has witnessed the rise of a new historical consciousness of postcolonial youth on and off the screen. The first part of this article looks at the neoliberal Casablanca that emerged in the aftermath of Morocco's market reforms in the 1980s and how that transformation engendered a new wave of urban cinema a decade later. The second part looks at Casanegra's affective economy of anger and revolt and the articulation of Moroccan youth's postcolonial subjectivity.

Understanding Libya's 'Revolution' through Transformation of the Jamahiriyya into a State of Exception,2013,"This article aims to provide a historical and structural context to the outbreak of the Libyan Revolution, which began in February 2011.

By identifying a crucial transformation within the long development of the Jamahiriyya through what Giorgio Agamben defines the state of exception, the article demonstrates how the official discourse entered in sharp contradiction with the very principles around which the regime had framed its moral purpose since the coup d'état in 1969. This metamorphosis resulted both in the slow, yet constant, erosion of the legitimacy of the regime and in the emergence of different forms of resistance. It is in such conditions, where emerging offstage resistances, what James Scott has called hidden transcripts of power, and counter-discourses began to come out, that the paper tries to assess the significance of the popular revolt and NATO's subsequent international intervention for the future of the country.

Qadhafi initially pursued a policy of confrontation with the former colonial power: he expelled the remaining Italian citizens in Libya, asked for post-colonial compensations and a revision of the 1956 treaty. Gradually, however, a new relationship developed: Italy badly needed Libyan oil, especially in view of the closing of the Suez Canal because of the Arab-Israeli wars, while Qadhafi needed to secure a fixed amount of oil revenues in order to build up domestic and international support for his revolution. Italian companies were also granted public works which were meant to improve Libyan infrastructure while Libyan oil profits could be invested in Italian stocks. Finally, Italy would provide Qadhafi with weapons and support for his regime, as the revelations about the 'Hilton Assignment' demonstrate. The author argues that this relationship gave both actors a wide freedom of manoeuvre within the context of the Cold War.","The Italo-Libyan relationship between 1969 and 1976 Based on the papers of former Italian statesman Aldo Moro and on several secondary sources, this article investigates the Italo-Libyan relationship between the rise to power of Qadhafi in 1969 and the mid-1970s.

In its theoretical approach, the article draws on the concept of non-traditional security, demonstrating that migration constitutes an anarchistic element in the relations between states, which goes beyond traditional foreign policy means. The article characterizes recent EU initiatives concerning migration and demonstrates that despite the fact that the EU has declared migration ""one of the strategic priorities in the external relations of the Union,"" it seems apparent that the EU has not been able to develop adequate new approaches regarding migration. Many of the suggested initiatives within the framework of the new EU foreign policy setup have not been established yet-they remain preliminary works in progress, projects in different stages or legislative procedures under negotiation between EU institutions.

Intersecting arcs of mobilisation: The transnational trajectories of Egyptian dockers' unions,2013,"This commentary explores the development of Egypt's dockers' unions since February 2011 in terms of two interlinked trajectories.

Ennahda Islamists and the Test of Government in Tunisia,2013,"After winning the 2011 elections, the Ennahda Islamist Party was the majority partner in successive coalition governments, whose poor performance - namely in the economic and security fields - disappointed the people's high post-revolutionary expectations. Opponents accused Ennahda of incompetence, greed for power and double talk. Many of the Ennahda-led governments' failures were due to factors beyond their control, but some did indeed depend on Ennahda's own political weaknesses. Nevertheless, Ennahda contributed positively to the overall development of Tunisia's political transition thanks to its moderation and pragmatism and its contribution remains paramount for the democratic consolidation of Tunisia and other political Islamic actors.

Turkey's 'double gravity' predicament: The foreign policy of a newly activist power,2013,"In November 2012 it was ten years since the Justice and Development Party became the party of government in Turkey. During that time, it has raised its profile abroad and sought to project its influence. In particular, it has tried to increase its impact on the European Union and the Middle East-the primary regions to which Turkey lies adjacent. This approach has been parcelled up in the name of turning Turkey from a state of marginal importance into a 'centre' country. The relationship to the EU got off to a good start; Turkey adopted liberal EU norms wholesale, before relations soured over Cyprus and membership in general. By 2006, ties were moribund. Links with the Middle East also started well. Turkey avoided the worst effects of the 2003 Iraq war; and its stature was at its zenith in the early months of the 'Arab Spring', when it raised the slogan 'let the people decide'. But this was hubris. By the summer of 2011, it had become clear that Turkey had miscalculated both with regard to the timing of regime change in Syria and its own leverage, whether on the ground or with NATO. Rather than a new, transregional power house, Turkey looked tentative, frequently inert and increasingly dependent on NATO. Turkey remains a country subject to the highly contrasting twin gravities of the EU and the Middle East in spite of its leadership aspirations and its will to accomplish more.

In each of the Arab countries shaken by revolt, no single force has fully appropriated the revolutionary momentum and claimed it as its own.

Beyond the Karbala paradigm: Rethinking revolution and redemption in Twelver Shi'a mourning rituals,2013,"In the mid-90s, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Iranian Ayatollah Khamene'i both banned bloody forms of self-flagellation such as tatbir (cutting the forehead with a sword), calling them backward and un-Islamic.

By closely reading the linguistic, conceptual, and juridical discourses that circulated in Syria in order to justify this position, the paper shows that the performers of tatbir conceived of these rituals in revolutionary, rather than reactionary, terms.

Youth and the revolution in Egypt: What kinship tells us,2013,"Studies of youth in Arab societies have tended to posit and explore their social exclusion, marginalization and even de-politicization. Events sparked by the January 25 uprising in Egypt have reconstructed youth in a contradictory light, hailing them as new symbols of the nation. Careful consideration of current thinking in the anthropology of kinship and the nation, however, cautions the audience of the revolution to think twice. Taking for granted the 'blurred boundaries' between kinship and the nation, this paper suggests that the transformation from 'totalizing and patricentric rule' in Egypt evokes the symbolism of kinship and its wider metaphorical uses, manipulations and transformations. It uses kinship to re-examine the role of youth in the Egypt revolution, on the one hand, and the end of Hosni Mubarak's totalizing and patricentric regime, on the other. Firstly, it shows how a discursive concern with youth's place in the revolution is simultaneously and more strongly a concern with kinship. It then sheds light on the kinship idiom that has defined the Egyptian nation since its birth to its 'demubarakization'. Finally, it shows how kinship and nation are mutually susceptible to manipulations and transformations in the aftermath of the revolution.

Building trust in biotechnology crops in light of the Arab Spring: A case study of Bt maize in Egypt,2012,"Background: The case of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize in Egypt presents a unique perspective on the role of trust in agricultural biotechnology (agbiotech) public-private partnerships (PPPs). This is especially relevant given the recent pro-democracy uprisings that spread throughout the Arab world that have significantly impacted the current political climate and status of both the public and private sector, and especially public-private collaborative initiatives. This case study aims to shed light on various trust-building practices adopted, and trust-related challenges faced, in the Bt maize project in Egypt. Methods: We reviewed published materials on Bt maize in Egypt and collected data through direct observations and semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders of the Bt maize project in Egypt. Data from the interviews were analyzed based on emergent themes to create a comprehensive narrative on how trust is understood and built among the partners and with the community. Results: We have distilled five key lessons from this case study. First, it is important to have transparent interactions and clearly defined project priorities, roles and responsibilities among core partners. Second, partners need to engage farmers by using proven-effective, hands-on approaches as a means for farmers to build trust in the technology. Third, positive interactions with the technology are important; increased yields and secure income attributable to the seed will facilitate trust. Fourth, there is a need for improved communication strategies and appropriate media response to obviate unwarranted public perceptions of the project. Finally, the political context cannot be ignored; there is a need to establish trust in both the public and private sector as a means to secure the future of agbiotech PPPs in Egypt. Conclusions: Most important to the case of Egypt is the effect of the current political climate on project success. There is reason to believe that the current political situation will dictate the ability of public institutions and private corporations to engage in trusting partnerships. ","Building trust in biotechnology crops in light of the Arab Spring: A case study of Bt maize in Egypt Background: The case of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize in Egypt presents a unique perspective on the role of trust in agricultural biotechnology (agbiotech) public-private partnerships (PPPs). This is especially relevant given the recent pro-democracy uprisings that spread throughout the Arab world that have significantly impacted the current political climate and status of both the public and private sector, and especially public-private collaborative initiatives. This case study aims to shed light on various trust-building practices adopted, and trust-related challenges faced, in the Bt maize project in Egypt. Methods: We reviewed published materials on Bt maize in Egypt and collected data through direct observations and semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders of the Bt maize project in Egypt. Data from the interviews were analyzed based on emergent themes to create a comprehensive narrative on how trust is understood and built among the partners and with the community. Results: We have distilled five key lessons from this case study. First, it is important to have transparent interactions and clearly defined project priorities, roles and responsibilities among core partners. Second, partners need to engage farmers by using proven-effective, hands-on approaches as a means for farmers to build trust in the technology. Third, positive interactions with the technology are important; increased yields and secure income attributable to the seed will facilitate trust. Fourth, there is a need for improved communication strategies and appropriate media response to obviate unwarranted public perceptions of the project. Finally, the political context cannot be ignored; there is a need to establish trust in both the public and private sector as a means to secure the future of agbiotech PPPs in Egypt. Conclusions: Most important to the case of Egypt is the effect of the current political climate on project success. There is reason to believe that the current political situation will dictate the ability of public institutions and private corporations to engage in trusting partnerships.

Pitched battles: The role of ultra soccer fans in the Arab spring,2012,"For decades soccer has constituted an alternative public space in the Middle East. Largely unnoticed by international experts, soccer provided a venue for the expression of pent-up anger and frustration against authoritarianism. By the time the Arab revolt erupted in December 2010, soccer had emerged as a key nonreligious, nongovernmental institution capable of confronting repressive regimes. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in Egypt, where militant, politicized, often violent ultras-organized clubs of soccer fans-played a key role in the protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign in February 2011. Since his resignation, Egyptian ultras have continued to play a prominent role in Egyptian street politics.

The impact of syrian uprising on Turkey-Syria relations,2012,"First, the article aims to analyze the reasons for drastic changes in bilateral relations between Turkey and Syria into a positive way in the end of the 1990s so as to explain how the relations between the two neighboring countries have been security oriented. Second, Turkey's new policy formulations such as being 'kind to everyone' or '360 degree policy', which became best evident in its relations with Syria in the first decade of the 21st century, are one of the main concerns of the study in order to show that Ankara made a great leap from being the gendarme of the West in the era of the Cold War to the role of bridging across troubled lands during the 2000s. In this context, Ankara's prioritization of trade links with the neighboring countries is worth to be mentioned. Most important of all, the article mainly aims to analyze under which circumstances Ankara made a volte-face after the outburst of the uprisings in Syria so as to explain the limits of maneuvering capability of Turkey's good neighborhood policy.","The impact of syrian uprising on Turkey-Syria relations First, the article aims to analyze the reasons for drastic changes in bilateral relations between Turkey and Syria into a positive way in the end of the 1990s so as to explain how the relations between the two neighboring countries have been security oriented.

Anti-sexual harrassment campaign in Egypt,2012,"This article analyzes how, for the decade before the Arab Spring, the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights (ECWR) promoted women's issues and sustained its campaign against widespread sexual harassment in Egypt. The article also reviews ECWR's activities after the mass mobilizations of the January 25th revolution. In authoritarian states, the risks inherent in challenging the regime decrease the probability that challenges will ever emerge or, if they do, continue for any significant duration. ECWR's prolonged campaign against sexual harassment, however, belies this observation. Analysis of the organization's activities provides an opportunity to examine elements that promote contentious claims making in high-risk, neopatriarchal environments. We found that the depth and strength of networks at the local level played a significant role. Also significant were ties with national and international group, which where were partly facilitated because of tourism's importance in Egypt. Through these ties, the ECWR leadership guided the organization toward increasingly promising outcomes in a unresponsive context. This case illuminates how, in the Middle East and elsewhere, civic organizations that focus on women's issues can navigate high-risk environments, whether due to neopatriarchal culture, authoritarian governance, or both.

"Dealing With a ""New"" Grievance: Should Anticorruption Be Part of the Transitional Justice Agenda?",2012,"Often presented as ""less serious"" than physical violence, and even sometimes used by peace-builders to buy social stability, in the Arab context corruption was one of the main grievances motivating the ""revolutions,"" on a par with joblessness and violations of freedom and other rights. To assuage public opinion, post-transition governments in Egypt, Tunisia, and beyond will have to equally address issues of corruption and the violent crimes, such as torture, committed by the security forces. Such initiatives raise the question of whether transitional justice mechanisms, as tools designed to face a legacy of mass human rights violations, are really adequate to address issues of corruption.

Libya's Arab spring: The long road from revolution to democracy,2012,"This article presents a critical account of Libya's incipient democratization, contextualizing it within the Arab Spring élan. This first line of inquiry is twofold: it critically assesses the meaning of democratization in the context of the Arab Middle East (AME), and briefly considers issues related to democratic knowledge and the Orientalist-Occidentalist inputs into this debate. Then, it situates this debate within the 'Arab Spring', looking at Western negative impressions of Arab revolts. A second line of inquiry is also twofold: While assessing the steps taken on the road to democratic reconstruction, it offers an unorthodox perspective on the North African country's transition. To this end, the article concludes that even violence is part and parcel of the process of power redistribution and reconstitution of a new polity. From this angle, whilst Libya's first election in nearly 50 years represents a step in the right direction along the path of political renewal, forms of unruliness - regional, religious or tribal - challenge Euro-American views of democracy as a single and fixed type of regime that precludes forms of disorder. In fact, unruliness has accompanied Libya's long and arduous process of ousting Gaddafi from power; this continues and will mark the transition process for sometime in the foreseeable future.

BACKGROUND: We documented the sequences of our medical response to mass casualties in Tahrir Square between January 28, 2011, and February 4, 2011, at ""Kasr El-Ainy"" Cairo University Hospital, the largest hospital in the Middle East and the tertiary referral center for all hospitals in Egypt that happened to be the closest to Tahrir Square. METHODS: At the peak of Tahrir Square demonstrations, injured protesters received first aid in a makeshift clinic inside Tahrir Square, manned by volunteer doctors and nurses, before they were evacuated to the Cairo University Hospital Surgical Casualty Department. General surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and critical care nurses from multidisciplinary teams hastily triaged and treated the incoming casualties. Thousands of casualties were seen at the peak of the uprising. This article provides a detailed review of mass casualties seen between January 28, 2011, and February 4, 2011. RESULTS: Of 3012 casualties, 453 were triaged as ""immediate care"" patients. On arrival, 339 of 453 patients (74.8%) needed surgical intervention within 6 hours of arrival whereas 74 of 453 patients (16.3%) were managed conservatively.

The 'Arab Spring' in the historical perspectives of Middle East politics,2012,"The events of the 'Arab Spring' appeared to be animated by slogans and objectives of universalist orientations to liberty, dignity and social justice, a departure from the ethno-religious nationalisms that dominated the politics of the region. They raised questions regarding the 'exceptionalism' of Arabs and Muslims, whom many observers and commentators considered to be tied to sentiments and solidarities of patrimonialism, tribe and religion. Yet, the forces that seemed to benefit from the transformations in Egypt and elsewhere were not those that made the 'revolution' but precisely religious and patriarchal parties which benefited from popular constituencies in elections. A consideration of the political history of the main countries concerned can throw some light on these transformations. The nationalist, often military, regimes which emerged from the independence struggles of mid-twentieth century headed ideological, populist, nationalist and 'socialist' movements and parties and authoritarian regimes which eliminated oppositional politics and social autonomies in favour of a corporatist welfare state. These regimes, facing economic and geo-political contingencies of the later decades were transformed into dynastic oligarchies and crony capitalism which broke the compact of welfare and subsidies leading to intensified impoverishment and repression of their populations. Popular strata were driven ever more into reliance on 'survival units' of kin and community, reinforcing communal and religious attachments at the expense of civic and associational life. These ties and sentiments come to the fore when the ruling dynasties are displaced, as in Iraq after the 2003 invasion or Egypt after the removal of Mubarak.

Its initial reticence was due to national security considerations, Italy's calculation of its national interest and the complexity of contemporary international relations. However, as events unfolded, the Italian position became clearer and firmer, such that in time Italy played a leading role that helped the global efforts to rebuild the new contemporary democratic Libya post-Qadhafi.The focus of this study is on the Italian role during the course of the Libyan 'spring' revolution, known now as the revolution of 17 February 2011, after the agreed date of its inception. Notwithstanding Rome's initial hesitancy, Italy is considered among the leading actors that participated in the alliance galvanized to act under the terms of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973. Here the contention is that Italy's full participation in the global alliance that carried out the UN mandates represented a process of transition in the Italian orientation from that of a soft power to that of a hard power as well. Thus, it is argued, when Italy's national security and interests are challenged in a global context, Italy is willing to use both soft and hard power.The findings of this study supported, by and large, the initial expectations concerning the important types of internal and external elements influencing the role of Italy in the Libyan crisis. Thus, Italy's position towards the Libyan revolution of 17 February 2011 may be attributed, among other factors, to its discernment of its national security and national interests in the context of competition in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East as well.

The study highlights considerations such as women's contributions to the recent MENA events as well as discourses concerning MENA women's 'advancement', to illuminate the need for a culture-centric public diplomacy that moves beyond the essentializing tendencies of western discourses.","['usa', 'tun']",GO,True,False,False,0
"The ""Arab spring"" and the new geo-strategic environment in the middle east",2012,"Contrary to the evaluation of several political leaders and analysts, the new Islamic governments that have been elected in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in the aftermath of the Arab Spring do not follow the zealous Islamic Iranian model. Rather, they tilt more to the Turkish Islamic democratic system. Significantly, the new Muslim Brothers' regime under president Morsi in Egypt has adopted a balanced realistic policy in domestic, regional and international affairs. While giving Shi'i Iran a cold shoulder, Morsi is inclined to play a leading role in a new regional Sunni-Muslim coalition with Saudi Arabia and Gulf Emirates, and Turkey, the major Sunni Muslim power. Although the would-be Ankara-Cairo new axis will be cautious not to alienate Tehran, it will probably make efforts to contain Iran's attempts to create a Shi'I crescent in the region to control the oil resources in the Gulf. Turkey and Egypt will try to reduce Iran's advances in Iraq and Syria by fostering their Sunni Muslim communities and helping the Syrian Muslims to topple the Alawi regime. Finally the Ankara-Cairo strategic axis, backed by most Sunni-Muslim regimes and in coordination with Obama's new administration, is likely to induce Israel to settle the Palestinian issue.","The ""Arab spring"" and the new geo-strategic environment in the middle east Contrary to the evaluation of several political leaders and analysts, the new Islamic governments that have been elected in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in the aftermath of the Arab Spring do not follow the zealous Islamic Iranian model.

The 'Jasmine Revolt' has made the 'Arab Spring': A critical discourse analysis of the last three political speeches of the ousted president of Tunisia1,2012,"The current article addresses person deixis in the last three speeches of the ousted president of Tunisia (OPT) from the perspectives of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and cognitive-pragmatics. It takes deixis to be individuated in the 'indexical field' by the deictic center, who fills them from within the social field at his/her discretion with 'social roles'. The way the filling takes place is a function of social proximity to or distance from the deictic center, which manipulates the constructed categories either closer to the CENTER or to the PERIPHERY of the image schema. In particular, it is argued that the OPT as a deictic center has constructed in the first two speeches two deictic categories, which would be called 'wandering WE' after and a peripheral THEY, through which he tried to maintain the political status quo and blame responsibility for the events on others. However, in the last speech, the OPT constructed two indexical dyads, namely I-YOU and WE-THEY. This shift is explained as an effort on the part of OPT to reproduce social power abuse, dominance, and inequality by way of making political concessions. Despite this, the shift is not felt to have created communality and closeness with the addressees since the policy of exclusion, authority, and domination precluded these concessions from being persuasive enough for the 'Jasmine Revolt' in Tunisia not to resist this power and go for regime change.

The role of ICTs in conflict transformation in Egypt,2012,"Purpose: The world is now in an era of condensed space and time in which cultural dynamics, including cultural conflict, are increasingly mediated by powerful technologies that hold the potential to accelerate change and create new opportunities. Conversely, these same powerful technologies, and the denial thereof, are used to sustain oppressive conditions and wage war for ideological (e.g. religion and politics) and material purposes (e.g. water, oil, and food). From the power of networking, in addition to the tyranny of isolation, information and communication technologies (ICTs) hold the potential for transformative change, as well as to maintain status quo through oppression and domination. The purpose of this paper is to create a model that attempts to delineate the role of ICTs in catalyzing a peaceful and democratic conflict transformation, while using a snapshot of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011; also to hypothesize that the adoption of modern digital technologies has created a mechanism for protests to achieve their ends through relatively peaceful mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis explores the use of ICTs in the protest process, using a snapshot of the Egyptian protests of 2011. The authors test a model of ICTs for peace and conflict transformation. Findings: It is found that, in essence, it effectively describes nuances of the modern protest process. However, the researchers propose a modified explanatory model of how ICTs are used, and can be used, for political mobilization on the road toward sustainable peace. Research limitations/implications: Every protest and every regime change is unique. The model used in this case needs to be tested further in other instances. Social implications: This model could be used to analyze other protests and uprising to understand an array of stakeholders' needs. Originality/value: Analyzing those events that are fundamentally being changed through the use of modern technology is a valuable contribution to the field.

"Egypt without Mubarak, Tunisia after Bin Ali: theory, history and the 'Arab Spring'",2012,"Focusing on Egypt and Tunisia the present contribution first analyses the scope and limits of political change prompted by the large-scale protests that in early 2011 led to the resignation of the two veteran presidents Zin al-Abdin Bin Ali and Husni Mubarak. In a second step it examines some broader theoretical implications of popular contestation, government responses and processes of regime transformation in both countries. Events over the past 15 months further question dominant approaches to the study of collective action in authoritarian contexts; however, contrary to recent claims, they fail to invalidate - in part even confirm - structural non-culturalist explanations for the longevity of authoritarian regimes in Arab countries. Above all, the contribution argues that some critical differences between the anciens régimes in Egypt and Tunisia account for the partly divergent dynamics and outcomes of change so far. At the same time, rather similar long-term processes of state formation have shaped the politics of both countries in ways that differ substantially from most other Arab countries.

I want to explore the question of 'political responsibility' in light of Nancy's work, and his Libération article in particular.

By setting Nancy's response against Derrida's work on spectrality and his critique of the founding declaration (in 'Declarations of Independence') we can more clearly appreciate the scope that Nancy's account of responsibility entails. I suggest that Derrida's logics of spectrality help not only critique Nancy's response but also understand the conditions that make his account of political responsibility possible.

Popular protests and the governance of scarce fresh water in Jordan,2012,"As uprisings and protests swept across the Arab world, some regimes collapsed, while others continue to confront sporadic but persistent street protests. The latter face the challenge of daily governance and the need to respond to the popular grievances that drive these protests.

Jordan has experienced periodic but persistent protests; people are dissatisfied with corruption, opaque governance, poor economic conditions, and inadequate public services-including insufficient household water. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation can use this domestic discontent to empower itself to improve its governance of scarce water resources. Poor implementation of existing water laws has contributed to numerous small- and large-scale thefts from the municipal water system, while ineffectively targeted subsidies contribute to the wasteful use and overconsumption of this scarce resource, as well as straining budgets. By drawing on domestic discontent, the ministry can empower itself to cut water subsidies available to high-consuming elites and high-income foreigners. The ministry can also draw on the current wave of dissatisfaction with corruption to implement existing laws that strongly prosecute water theft. Together, these policy changes can save substantial quantities of water that can be delivered to households that lack water, while also decreasing budget deficits.

"Arab women, social media, and the arab spring: Applying the framework of digital reflexivity to analyze gender and online activism",2012,"This essay analyzes the engagement of Arab feminist activisms online, most notably during the citizen revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and, specifically, women's use of online social networking to aid social change. Building on research examining how Arab activists and activist organizations, including feminist organizations, mobilize, produce knowledge, and develop and share resources online and, in particular, drawing from research on Arab activisms and social media this study aims to understand how online activist discourses function, both locally and globally. To do so, we utilize a schema of information production and consumption devised to analyze activist engagement and citizen journalism, particularly the negotiation of communication messages by various agents through multiple stages of transmission and dissemination (Newsom, Lengel, & Cassara, C, 2011). We look at the ideal of local knowledge as it is transformed into global knowledge, and how the messages are open to manipulation and bias through the various stages of mediation and gatekeeping cited in the framework. Through the application of this framework, we can see how gendered messages are constructed, essentialized, reconstructed, and made invisible by the consumer media system.","Arab women, social media, and the arab spring: Applying the framework of digital reflexivity to analyze gender and online activism This essay analyzes the engagement of Arab feminist activisms online, most notably during the citizen revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and, specifically, women's use of online social networking to aid social change.

Tipping the Balance Towards Intra-Maghreb Unity in Light of the Arab Spring,2012,"In the late 1980s, prospects for Maghreb integration were high; the process of integration reflected the aspirations of Maghreb states and societies. However, analysis shows that the process was merely a response to internal and external events of that period, namely, economic difficulties, 'fortress Europe', and the rise of radical Islamism. Following the Arab Spring, incessant calls for unity have re-emerged. Once again, these calls for unity, after a long period of tense relations, especially between Algeria and Morocco, have resulted from internal and external constraints. The threats to the incumbent regimes and/or the insecurity prevailing domestically and at the borders have compelled the Maghreb states to seek greater cooperation to overcome the hardships with which they are faced.

Why did the Egyptian Middle Class March to Tahrir Square?,2012,"Building on the extensive literature on relations between the state and social classes, this article examines the reasons leading important sectors of the middle class to revolt against Egypt's Mubarak regime. The role of the middle class in the Egyptian uprising is both crucial and somewhat paradoxical. It is crucial because it was the middle class that overwhelmingly mobilized against Mubarak, with workers and peasants remaining, at least initially, on the sidelines. It is also paradoxical because the Mubarak regime had courted the middle class for a long time and the latter did benefit from its privileged relations with the regime. However, the neo-liberal reforms undertaken more recently undermined many of the material and political achievements of the middle class, favouring instead a new class of tycoon capitalists linked to the regime. This created extensive dissatisfaction within the middle class, which seized on the opportunity provided by the circumstances of the Arab Spring to demand political change.

Surfing the Democratic Tsunami in Morocco: Apolitical Society and the Reconfiguration of a Sustainable Authoritarian Regime,2012,"The democratic wave seems to have finally reached the shores of the Middle East. Nevertheless, some countries have been less affected than others. Morocco in particular is singled out as an 'exception' and, despite large protests beginning in February 2011, the country seems not to have experienced significant democratic change. This article questions the degree to which Morocco is indeed an exception. Building on an analysis of the political context prior to the protests, it explores the political adjustments that the Moroccan regime has been forced to undertake following the demonstrations inspired by the Arab Spring. Largely unnoticed by international observers, Morocco has also undergone what may well be a watershed moment in its history. This article argues that changes to the political system as a result of the Arab uprisings may have far greater long-term significance than it appears at first glance. The case of Morocco exemplifies the paradox of analysing Arab politics as if the paradigms of democratization and of authoritarian resilience are in opposition to each other. This is not the case, as many of their assumptions can be collapsed in a single explanatory framework which can genuinely account for regional developments.

Syria: Neoliberal reforms in health sector financing: Embedding unequal access?,2012,"The recent volatility and uprisings in several countries of the Arab world have been interpreted by the West solely as a popular demand for political voice. However, in all the countries of the region, including those in which there is ongoing violent opposition, the underlying economic dysfunction speaks for itself. The legacy of joblessness, food riots, and hunger is commonplace and is most often related to structural reforms and austerity measures promoted by the IMF and World Bank. These have played a significant role in reinforcing the rich-poor divide over the past three decades, fostering inequal-ity, suffering, social divisions, and discontent, which are often overlooked by Western observers. In Syria, the state introduced policies for the liberalization of the economy as early as 2000; these were formalized into the 10th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010). Economic liberalization has been supported by the European Union with technical support from the German Technical Cooperation agency (GTZ). Changes made to the health sector and the labor market in-clude: the piloting of health insurance schemes to replace universal coverage, the charging of fees for health services in public hospitals, and job losses across the board. While the West views discontent in Syria largely as political, its own role in promoting economic reforms and social hardship has been largely missed. In large part, discontent in Syria and in the region as a whole are a part of a phenomenon that has repeatedly highlighted the failure of policies that aim at rapid commercialization with little con-sideration for pre-existing disparities in wealth and resources. This paper traces some of the proposed changes to the financing of health care and examines the implications for access and equity.","Syria: Neoliberal reforms in health sector financing: Embedding unequal access?

From Neoliberalism to Social Justice: The Feasability of Full Employment in Tunisia,2012,"The educated unemployed youth of Tunisia have played a crucial role in the 2010 uprisings that have sparked revolutions across the entire Arab world (and beyond). It has been argued that the recent economic situation in Tunisia is the culmination of three decades of neoliberal economic policies that have contributed to the rise in income inequality, the lack of upward mobility for educated youth, and the removal of social safety nets for the working class. This paper argues that the economic success of post-Ben Ali Tunisia must do away with neoliberal economic policies and focus instead on direct job creation through public sector spending. A six-year full employment program is proposed for Tunisia in the Post Keynesian Institutionalist tradition of Hyman Minsky. The main purpose of this paper is to address the technical question of financial affordability of direct job creation, rather than focusing on the logistical aspects of the program. The paper demonstates that this program can create full employment, contribute an additional 4.8 percentage points to GDP growth, and cost 3.36 percent of GDP.

An enterprise revolution for Egyptian universities,2012,"The purpose of this paper is to determine the changes that are needed in order to create entrepreneurial graduate students and institutions in Egypt that are more relevant to the needs of the country post revolution, by applying the theories of entrepreneurship education and intrapreneurship to Egyptian universities. The authors use existing research on entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial institutions, combined with the results of primary research on Egyptian students, to determine what the country's universities ought to do if they are to meet the challenge. It is concluded that Egyptian universities will need to transform not only what they teach, but how they teach, whilst at the same time transforming their own institutions in order to create more entrepreneurial learning environments. The paper is based on the application of theory and a limited study in one institution.

The results should inform both policy formulation and the delivery of education in Egypt and the Region.

A new feminism? Gender dynamics in Morocco's February 20th movement,2012,"The February 20th movement shows new modes of engagement with feminism, despite a striking absence of feminist organizations from the protest movement. Nevertheless, and in sharp contrast with most accounts that posit the irrelevance of feminism for Moroccan youth's identifications and political subjectivities, I argue that feminism has not only penetrated the social imaginary of a new generation of activists, but has also informed their practices. What kind of tension does this appropriation of feminism by the youth of February 20th bring about with traditional feminist circles? Does this high visibility of women in February 20th indicate the rise of a new feminism? I will first briefly locate February 20th in a genealogy of feminist activism in Morocco showing places of friction, influence and tensions. Second, I will provide some indications of what I call a new feminism. Third, I will analyze the gender dynamics among the various components of February 20th, notably the secular and Islamist. I will conclude by sketching a new map of protests led by women and not necessarily intelligible under the old cartography of feminism.","A new feminism?

Yemen's Arab Spring - Democratic Opening or Regime Maintenance?,2012,"Yemen's revolt of 2011, like its counterparts in Tunisia and Egypt, raises many questions about recent analysis of authoritarianism in the Arab world. The long-standing regime of Ali Abdullah al-Saleh and his General People's Congress (GPC) party seemed to represent a classic case of authoritarian upgrading. The surprisingly open political system in Yemen, which followed the emergence of the new state in 1990, masked the extent to which the president exerted control through a network of informal alliances and, in recent years, external support and patronage. The widespread and persistent protests against the regime which led ultimately to a handover of power to Saleh's vice-president and the formation of a government of national unity between the GPC and the opposition, seem to constitute yet another set of challenges to the theses of authoritarian upgrading and Arab hostility to democracy. However, the narrative of popular protest leading to the demise of a reviled authoritarian regime received a setback as the Yemeni situation developed. The protest movement, which emerged, in the first instance, from outside established centres of political activity, was quickly overtaken and marginalized both by the established parties of opposition and by tribal actors. While Saleh's exit from office represents a major rupture in Yemeni political life, the future is best read in terms of the reassertion of pre-existing political dynamics, both domestic and international rather than in hopeful but unfounded expectations of democratic transformation.

The emergence of a new labor movement in Jordan,2012,"The article examines the emergence of a new labor movement in Jordan. Although Jordan may appear little affected by the Arab uprisings, as early as January 2011 Jordanians were in the streets for the same reasons Tunisians and Egyptians were: protesting against economic conditions and privatization of state resources, demanding the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet, and calling for political reform and an end to elite corruption. In 2010, Jordan Labor Watch reported over 140 labor actions of some kind, a significant increase over preceding years. The most obvious reasons for the protest wave related to the dire economic situation: the rising cost of fuel and utilities, depreciating wages and growing unemployment. Jordanians associated these difficult circumstances with the privatization of several key public assets, which coincided with the economic downturn.","The emergence of a new labor movement in Jordan The article examines the emergence of a new labor movement in Jordan.

"Popular Mobilization in Syria: Opportunity and Threat, and the Social Networks of the Early Risers",2012,"This paper explores the dynamics and underlying conditions of the first few months of the uprising in Syria, from mid-March 2011 until the summer of that year. Together with the contributions from Dalmasso and Kandil, it exploits the opportunity created by the Arab uprisings to shed new light on patterns of social mobilization and collective action that research programmes focusing on authoritarian resilience had tended to overlook. Specifically, it presents an analysis that critically and loosely borrows from, communicates with and hopes to make a modest contribution to social movement theory (SMT). While threat and opportunity are necessary elements for popular mobilization, they are not sufficient. Both 'threat' and 'opportunity' therefore need to be contextualized within the specific social and political environment, real or perceived, of the 'early risers' in Syria, in order to appreciate their local significance. The article further argues that protestors, when under threat and faced with the opportunity, collectively rose up by capitalizing on their dense social networks. Strong clan-based or tribal social structures, circular labour migration, cross-border linkages and proliferating practices denoted as 'criminal' variably played a key role in cementing these social networks. It is also contended that these networks' ability easily to dissolve into one another due to their high degree of interconnectedness was instrumental in collective mobilization and their ability to pose a strong and enduring challenge to the regime.

"Common interests, closer allies: How democracy in Arab States can benefit the West",2012,"Western leaders have reacted ambivalently to the antigovernment protests during the ""Arab Spring"" and the political developments that have followed in countries such as Egypt and Tunisia. This Article argues that they should see democratic change in Arab countries as an important long-term goal and seek opportunities to support it. Democratization would advance Western countries' interests, as well as the ideals they proclaim and the interests of Arab citizens who aspire to govern themselves. The Article synthesizes empirical social science, social science theory, and policy analysis that strongly suggest that democratization of Arab countries would serve core Western interests in the region. First, democracy would have a stabilizing impact inside Arab countries, reducing the risk of civil war and internal terrorism in the long run and quite possibly in the short run. Second, interstate conflict, which this Article's original empirical findings show to be frequent in the Arab world, would likely diminish in the long run as more Arab states became democratic. Third, terrorist attacks against Western countries would be less likely to originate in Arab countries if the latter became solid democracies. Finally, Western countries' fundamental interests in the region align more closely with those of Arab publics than those of Arab dictators, so Arab citizens are likely to be better partners for the West. This benefit will not materialize automatically, however. Western policymakers will have to overcome ordinary Arabs ' well-justified skepticism about their intentions. Their first step must be to transform their attitudes and policies so as to respect Arab citizens as equals and partners. The Article also considers the possibility that Islamists elected to lead new Arab democracies would use state power to harshly oppress women and minorities. It concludes that this is unlikely, but not out of the question. Continued autocracy is likely to strengthen Islamists' support anyway, so Western countries should not hesitate to support democratization out of concern over what Islamists might do in office. Western countries must step carefully as they try to support democratic change in Arab countries. Their power is limited and they cannot be the primary drivers of change. Their efforts must be guided by subtle analysis of local power dynamics and of how their influence functions in each national context.","Common interests, closer allies: How democracy in Arab States can benefit the West Western leaders have reacted ambivalently to the antigovernment protests during the ""Arab Spring"" and the political developments that have followed in countries such as Egypt and Tunisia.

Revolts in Syria: Tracking the Convergence Between Authoritarianism and Neoliberalism,2012,"With the popular revolt in Syria entering its ninth month, it is becoming more evident that the current regime is reaching its historical limits. To understand the origin of these revolts, however, one needs to explore the longer-term history. This report situates Syria's uprisings within the wider Arab trajectory and argues that the state socialist model built by the Syrian Ba'ath in the 1960s has given way to an organic relationship between Westernized merchant classes and authoritarian forces. However, the increasing fusion between neoliberal and authoritarian forces also created the possibilities for the social revolts.

A different struggle for Syria: Becoming young in the middle east,2012,"Democracy, civil society and likewise their 'promotion' have for a long time shaped foreign policies inside as much as outside the countries of the Middle East. Since January 2011, however, these notions and policies have been challenged by a seemingly new concept, that of the 'Arab Youth'. While the term 'Arab Youth' is coined to denote the grassroots nature of the uprisings, as a political category it may be reinforcing the paternalistic presumptions of authoritarian regimes and global hegemonic power structures, which use it to undermine the capacity of the wider population for democratic change. Without empirically grounded and theoretically challenging works, 'Arab Youth' may perpetuate the same inequalities and top-down misunderstanding that 'democracy promotion' connotes within the Middle East. By locating Syrian youth within contemporary struggles through ethnographic case studies, this paper aims to sketch a nuanced, complex and colourful picture of the multifaceted ways that young people reinforce, resist and negotiate power relations in contemporary Syria.

Towards the Egyptian revolution: Activists’ perceptions of social media for mobilization,2012,"The role that social media could play in engaging people in the democratic process has recently gained more attention following the series of mass protests and revolutions that has swept the Arab region starting with Tunisia, then emulated in Egypt, and now taking place in Libya. It has been argued that those revolutions were linked, at least in the preliminary stages, to the active use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. This article attempts to shed light on these assertions by reporting some early observations from a study which was conducted immediately prior to the revolution in Egypt. In particular it explores the young activists’ perceptions of the potential of social media for mobilizing activism in authoritarian regimes. It thus helps situating social media (SM) in the spectrum of political engagement by gauging young activists’ motivations for utilizing those outlets for political participation aimed at social and political change. This article relies on a survey of a snowball sample of young Egyptian activists, along with focus group discussions (FGD) also, to seek answers to questions about contextual factors such as media scepticism, political efficacy and fear of authority, which are expected to relate to social media motivations and users’ tendencies to engage in forms of online and offline political participation. The findings indicate that young activists were mainly driven by guidance and surveillance needs in their political utilization of social networking sites.

Civil unrest in North Africa-Risks for natural gas supply?,2012,"The uprising and military confrontation in Libya that began in February 2011 has led to disruptions of gas supplies to Europe. An analysis of how Europe has compensated for these missing gas volumes shows that this situation has not affected security of supply. However, this situation would change if the North African uprising were to spread to Algeria. Since Algeria is a much more important gas supplier to Europe than is Libya, more severe consequences would be likely. Applying a natural gas infrastructure model, we investigate the impact of supplier disruptions from both countries for a summer and winter period. Our analysis shows that disruptions in the low-demand summer months could be compensated for, mainly by LNG imports into several European countries. An investigation of a similar situation at the beginning of the winter shows that security of supply would be severely compromised and that disruptions to Italian consumers would be unavoidable. The analysis thereby highlights the importance of taking the political stability of supply countries into account when assessing the security of European gas imports.

Tunisian women in the twenty-first century: past achievements and present uncertainties in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution,2012,"The recent and dramatic changes in Tunisia since the Jasmine Revolution have brought new challenges for its citizens and for its women in particular. Tunisian women, long considered the most liberated in the Arab-Muslim world, are now seeing a growing conservative mind-set spreading across the country. The more frequent appearance of women wearing headscarves and men sporting beards in public, if only an outward symbol of Islam, is unusual behaviour in the traditionally secular, post-independent Tunisia. This more conservative phenomenon, although not the primary driver of the recent revolution, has secured a legitimate place in Tunisian society since January 2011. Many Tunisian feminists and NGOs fear that this legitimacy will eventually threaten women's active participation in public and private life, legally guaranteed through the 1956 Code of Personal Status (CPS). In this paper, we examine pre- and post-revolutionary Tunisia to understand the importance and influence of the rising tide of conservatism and its potential impact on women's rights. Two principle questions frame this study: (1) what factors have prompted the re-emergence of the more religiously based conservatism in secular Tunisia in recent years? and (2) will the new Tunisia safeguard the CPS through its transitional period and thereafter? The authors use an interdisciplinary approach in their study, integrating Tunisia's unique past - grounded in historical, political, and socio-economic events and conditions - with the interviews of 33 citizens prior to January 2011, and then evaluate the post-revolutionary events in light of the former. The analyses reveal that before January 2011, the more conservative behaviour was linked to the present-day challenges and global developments, and not necessarily to a deep-rooted Islamic practice and/or religiosity. Since the revolution, however, the legitimate acknowledgement of certain Islamic practices and movements, previously banned over a period of 50 years, has created an audible voice in the public arena which, in turn, has created a renewed and heightened concern about the possible deterioration of women's rights.

Women's rights in Muslim societies: Lessons from the Moroccan experience,2012,"Major changes have taken place in Muslim societies in general during the last decades. Traditional family and social organizational structures have come into conflict with the perceptions and needs of development and modern state-building. Moreover, the international context of globalization, as well as changes in intercommunity relations through immigration, have also deeply affected social and cultural mutations by facilitating contact between different cultures and civilizations. Of the dilemmas arising from these changes, those concerning women's and men's roles were the most conflictive issues because of different interpretations and evaluations of historical, religious and/or cultural heritages. In the case of Morocco, for over 30 years, women's and human rights NGOs have acted and advocated to promote women's rights. The main disputes have concerned the distinction between what is within the requirements of Islam and what is the consequence of traditional social beliefs and practices. This ended nevertheless with the adoption by the Parliament of a new Family Law proclaimed in February 2004. This law was the result of a process of consultation and national debate, which made possible substantial progress in terms of proclaimed values of equality of rights between men and women, with the support of most national political and social leaders. Several lessons can be learned from the Moroccan experience. The crucial role of civil society, the political support of the state at its highest level, the working methodology of the Royal Advisory Commission and the final process for the adoption of the new code were from the most determinant parameters. In light of recent developments in some majority-Muslim countries, the future of women's rights is a key issue of the so-called Arab spring. Muslim women's challenges and struggles are not only ideological and legal battles, but they are also social and political struggles for which one of the major conditions is to prevent and prohibit the use of Islam as a political instrument. Muslim societies need to educate people properly and change their traditional representations and patterns of thought. To promote justice, equity and equality in general, as well as to protect women's economic rights, they need appropriate economic and social policies. Then women can really promote, protect and benefit from the advances of their legal status.

It examines how the Arab media reported the fall of Hosni Mubarak's regime in Egypt early 2011. The study focuses on how the pan-Arab satellite news channel al-Jazeera handled the news from narrative and visual perspectives. We shall argue that al-Jazeera, among others, has played a crucial role in the process of transformation, both during the uprising itself and beyond it.

Palestinian youth and the Arab Spring. Learning to think critically: A case study,2012,"The subject of this paper is a case study based on evidence gathered informally through delivery of a course at Birzeit University entitled 'Modern and Contemporary European Civilization' and from end-of-semester evaluations that asked students to reflect on the impact of the course on their lives. The author is, naturally, aware of the limitation of the methodology used in this study, and does not claim that its findings can be generalized authoritatively to a wider group of people in the Arab world. What is clear, however, if one considers reviews of internet blogs and media programme debates, is that extrapolations from this evidence have wider reference, revealing commonalities and similarities between Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories and Arab youth involved in the Arab Spring on the subject of political reform. The discussions engaged in by my students actually parallel the debates generated by traditionalists and secularists in post-revolution Egypt and Tunisia. These debates revolve around what it means to live in a civil, democratic state that grants social justice and freedoms, and crucially, at present led by scholars and politicians, address the possibility of reconciling the concept of modernity with Islam and the legislative framework of Islamic law (sharī cah). It could be argued that the data collected are specific to this one case study, since Palestinians living under Israeli occupation form a unique group in the Arab world and probably are more concerned with basic issues of daily life and more sensitive to Western concepts of modernity. The significance of this data is, however, that gathered during the Arab Spring, they were based on reactions to material covered in a class which related to issues raised by the Arab revolutions, such as democracy, liberalism and revolution. Furthermore, these tentative findings suggest that more research is needed into issues such as the role of education, gender, tolerance and the reconciliation of Islam with modernity - areas of interest which are of particular importance at a time when Islamic groups are winning elections and debates on concepts of authority, democracy and liberalism occupy the foreground of media programmes in countries such as Egypt and Tunisia.

Never before had this question been debated so intensely. I look at two contrasting ways of addressing it. On the one hand, seasoned political analysts (mostly political scientists) were predominantly saying no, Egypt is not Tunisia. On the other hand, activists were talking dreams and poetry, especially invoking lines from two famous Arab poets on the power of popular will and the inevitability of revolution.

Escalation of social conflict during popular upheavals: Evidence from Bahrain,2012,"Bahrain experienced rapidly growing sectarian strife as a result of the ""Day of Rage"" uprising organized in February 2011. The aim of this article is to assess the sources of latent hostility as well as to explain why the social conflict manifested itself and why it took on a sectarian dimension. The appraisal is based on the elements of Hocker and Wilmot's conflict assessment model, which focuses on the adversaries' perceptions of the conflict. Through an in-depth examination of created stereotypes we evaluate miscommunication between adversaries and ultimately, rigidity of positions and polarization of society. We conclude that, following this pattern of development, the social conflict ultimately enters into a destructive phase, negatively impacting the prospects of conflict resolution. The social division engulfing Bahrain is representative of the power struggle and confessional tensions in the Gulf region.

Morocco and democratic transition: A reading of the constitutional amendments - their context and results,2012,"This article, originally delivered in the Fall of 2011 at a seminar held in Beirut at the Centre for Arab Unity Studies, examines the 2011 amendments to the Moroccan Constitution in light of the historical background. The tumultuous events of the so-called 'Arab Spring' brought new urgency to the issue of constitutional reforms that had been broached initially on the accession of Muhammad VI to the throne in 1999. Since independence, Moroccan political society has typically been vibrant, democratic and home to numerous political parties of various orientations and, since the 1970s, has witnessed calls by various sides for constitutional reforms as well as for the institution of a constitutional or parliamentary monarchy. On 9 March 2011 Muhammad VI gave a momentous address subjecting the issue of royal authority to public deliberations. This topic had previously ranked as one of the few unapproachable taboos of the political scene. A vital driving force in the process of constitutional reform has been the youthful February 20 Movement that was instrumental in the mobilization of millions of Moroccans and led to submitting the new draft Constitution to popular referendum and its ratification on 1 July 2011. Unlike other Arab countries, Morocco's functioning democracy, its well-established political parties and the fact that the issue of constitutional reforms had already been on the table meant that when Moroccans descended into the streets they had a set of clearly defined demands - demands that were also less drastic than those being made in other countries. Yet while Moroccan politics have been highly developed and articulate since the 1940s, the events of the Arab Spring provided the necessary shock and catalyst to transform relative complacency into action. The dense topography of mature political parties and organizations in Morocco factored in two ways: first, it permitted a stable environment for democratic transition, which was not new as a concept; and in a somewhat less positive regard, the compromises and concessions to numerous sides dictated by Moroccan political pluralism led - in the drafting of the amended Constitution - to a document of somewhat indistinct character. The King's authority, in particular, is not so limited as a contemporary parliamentary monarchy and he retains a distinct set of powers, particularly under the aegis of his role as 'Commander of the Faithful' (Amir al-Mu'minin). Nevertheless, there have been significant changes and this article examines the nature of these, their genesis and links to various political trends and parties. The uniqueness of the Moroccan model is demonstrated, though other Arab countries, notably Jordan, may follow a similar path.

Strength and vulnerability after Egypt's Arab Spring uprisings,2012,"Following the revolts that unseated Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, a contradictory discourse has emerged in which Egyptians imagine themselves to be resilient in body and spirit but also enfeebled by years of political corruption and state negligence. During the mass protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the regime's orchestrated violence neither crushed the movement nor provoked activists to abandon their vow of peaceful protest. However, Egyptians' pride in the physical and moral resilience that enabled this feat is infused with an understanding of its fragility; many face vulnerabilities to disease within the context of environmental toxins, malnutrition, and a broken, overtaxed health care system. And they mourn the deterioration of moral principles and values after years of brutal oppression and social injustice. These conflicting views-of vitality and vulnerability-have led to a dizzying oscillation between optimism and despair; even as people celebrate the accomplishments of the uprisings, they are also keenly aware of the formidable challenges that lie ahead.

Invisible refugees and/or overlapping refugeedom? Protecting sahrawis and palestinians displaced by the 2011 Libyan uprising,2012,"This article examines the experiences of two North African and Middle Eastern refugee populations (Sahrawis and Palestinians) affected by the 2011 conflict in Libya who have remained largely invisible to the international community. The challenges that they have faced since the outbreak of violence in February 2011, and the nature of international responses to these challenges, highlight a range of interconnected issues on both conceptual and practical dimensions. After outlining the scale and nature of the internal and international displacement arising from the 2011 conflict, and the history of these refugees' presence in Libya, the article explores whether Sahrawis and Palestinians can be categorised and conceptualised as 'refugees' in Libya, given their 'voluntary' migration to the country for educational and/or employment purposes. Drawing on a number of historical examples of protection activities by UNHCR for Sahrawi and Palestinian 'refugee-migrants', the article explores the potential applicability of a framework that highlights 'overlapping refugeedoms' without negating refugees' agency. Given that neither population has a 'country of origin' or effective diplomatic protection, the article then explores which state and non-state actors could be considered to be responsible for their protection in this conflict situation. Finally, analysing the 'solutions' promoted for Sahrawi and Palestinian refugees in this context leads to an assessment of whether such responses can be considered to offer effective protection to these populations. Ultimately, the article examines a range of protection gaps that emerge from these groups' experiences during the 2011 North African uprisings, arguing in favour of a critical assessment of the protection mechanisms in place to support refugees who 'voluntarily' migrate for economic and educational purposes. Such an evaluation is particularly important given policy-makers' increasing interest in presenting mobility as a 'fourth durable solution'. ","Invisible refugees and/or overlapping refugeedom?

The first signs of the new Arab cold war predate the Arab uprisings of 2011-2012, and became especially clear during the 2006 war between Israel and Hizballah.

This article represents the outgrowth of the experience of years of public service on both the national level and, since January 2009, at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Though it does not pretend and should not be construed to represent the views of the UNDP on major global issues, it inevitably reflects the fruit of long hours of work on its behalf, in several parts of the world. Unlike some other inter-regional organizations, the UNDP encompasses all Member States in its remit. For obvious reasons, however, its workaday operations are more directly related to the concerns of developing countries. In democratic governance, which is a major area of UNDP activity, the countries and the regions that are currently undergoing a rapid course of change stand out for consideration.

It happens that my watch has seen years of deep crises, both natural and man-made. Indeed, some of these crises have also demonstrated the measure and the progress of globalization.

While it is too soon to write al Qaeda's obituary, its erosion came well before the death of its historic leader. This essay examines al Qaeda's post-9/11 evolution, its strategy, and its steady fragmentation. Since the destruction of its Taliban Afghan sanctuary, al Qaeda has been through many mutations, none of which, over time, has been successful. This essay argues that al Qaeda's failures in Iraq contributed substantially to the organization's decline.

Yemen's Arab spring leaves its air force in disarray,2012,"Sharon Weinberger explains how Yemen's air force is facing functional difficulties despite heavy US investment. The strike by air force rank and file started in January and comes at the end of Yemen's Arab Spring, a popular and at times bloody revolution that eventually led to a negotiated transfer of power from Yemen's president of 33 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to Abdu Rabu Mansur Hadi, previously the vice president. With thousands of other officers striking alongside Al Yemeni, the protest has brought the air force to a near standstill at a time when Yemen is a central theater of operations in the ongoing US war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates. The result, despite several hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance from the US to Yemen over the past four years, is that a key tool in the global war against Islamic terrorists is essentially grounded.","Yemen's Arab spring leaves its air force in disarray Sharon Weinberger explains how Yemen's air force is facing functional difficulties despite heavy US investment.

Though calls for international and regional action have recently intensified, there exists no clear international leadership or consensus on how to handle Syria.

Arab revolutions and the Iranian uprising: Similarities and differences,2012,"A year and a half after the Iranian uprising in 2009, the unprecedented popular uprisings in several Arab countries at the beginning of 2011 provided some of the most evocative moments when power met its opposite, in decisive and surprising ways. In a matter of weeks, some of the most powerful hereditary/republican regimes in the region, such as Tunisia's and Egypt's, crumbled under relentless pressure and opposition from highly mediated ""street politics"" that shook the foundations of authoritarian and repressive rule, undermining hegemonic structures and configurations of power within nation sates and between nations. Technology, as in the case of Iranian uprising, emerged as one of the main explanations on offer to make sense of this new wave of revolts against tyranny. The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt in particular, inevitably drew some comparisons with the Iranian uprising of 2009. The most significant question for many Iranians was how come that the two revolts in Iran and Tunisia which immediately and rather simplistically labelled as 'Twitter revolution' had a totally different outcome? Many in Iran started raising such searching questions: ""Chera Tunis Toonest v ma natoonestim?"" (Why Tunisia could and we couldn't) or ""toonestan az Tunis miad""! (Capability comes from Tunis). So how can we compare Arab Revolutions with that of situation in Iran? What the different outcomes tell us about the similarities and the differences, and what lessons can be learnt?

Politicizing identity: Code choice and stance-taking during the Egyptian revolution,2012,"This study aims to offer a fresh look at the relationship between identity, stance-taking and code choice. The study provides three examples of different forms of Egyptian public discourse related directly to identity that took place during the 2011 revolution of Egypt, a time when state TV media stations cast doubt on the identity of the protestors by utilizing linguistic resources. This article argues that during the process of stance-taking speakers employ linguistic resources, discourse resources and structural resources. These linguistic resources include the associations and indexes of different languages and varieties, in this case Standard Arabic (SA), Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) and English. This stance-taking process depends on code-switching as a mechanism that lays claims to different indexes and thus appeals to different ideologies and different facets of identity. Second, this study also shows how speakers use public discourse in order to construe language as a classification category and an identity builder.

The Arab revolutions; the emergence of a new political subjectivity,2012,"Since late 2010, the Arab World has witnessed regime changes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya; and revolts by Arab citizens are still underway in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, along with reform initiatives at different levels. These processes cannot be accurately be described by Orientalist terms such as 'Arab Spring', 'Arab unrest' or the 'Facebook Revolution', where such categorizations fail to account for the radical transformation in politics and values that the Arab World is undergoing and the significance that resides in the confluence of social and democratic demands. The ultimate fate of these popular uprisings remains in the balance, but it is all too clear that they have produced the most dramatic changes in the region since the mid-twentieth century which marked the end of the colonial era.

Brand Dubai and its competitors in the Middle East: An image and reputation analysis,2012,"Dubai is probably one of the best known examples of a city brand that has established itself in a very short period of time while riding the waves of globalization. This has resulted in a schizophrenic image among the global audience combining Middle-Eastern stereotypes with images of a modern, rich, glamorous metropolis. However, while the image of modern Dubai has been challenged by the global financial crisis, it seems that competition in the region has stepped in. This article therefore studies the competitive brand position of Dubai, compared to Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Bahrain, through content analysis of global social media using Radian6. It shows that Dubai has attracted and still attracts most attention in mainstream as well as social media. This buzz is generally positive with the exception of the enormous amount of noise around the Dubai debt crisis announcement end of 2009. Nevertheless, the competition has been able to attract lots of positive attention for short periods of time occasionally overshadowing Dubai in recent years with the Abu Dhabi and Bahrain Grand Prix and the selection of Qatar as host for the 2022 FIFA world cup soccer. Lastly, a dramatic change that has occurred in the second quarter of 2011 is the fact that social media buzz (more so than mainstream media attention) for Bahrain has drowned out the competition in the region. However, this consists of generally very negative buzz around the opposition protests and government reactions. Therefore, all in all, it seems that Dubai still has a lot going for itself.

Global poverty and biofuel production: Food vs. fuel,2012,"From early 2008, the issue of rising global food prices moved to the forefront of the international political agenda. As a result of higher food prices, tens of millions of people were pushed into hunger and poverty around the world. Civil unrest flared up in North Africa, Vietnam and Haiti as countries introduced export restrictions on food subsidies and instituted price controls. Food price inflation has been sparking protests in North Africa that toppled longstanding presidents in Tunisia and Egypt. In the food markets, unfavourable weather conditions, rising fuel costs, rising biofuels production, and trade restrictions have added to upward price pressures. Higher food and fuel prices have serious macroeconomic effects throughout the global economy, including adverse effects on growth and inflation, and large swings in the terms of trade - with important balance of payments repercussions. In this paper, we analyse the immediate causes of food price; in particular the role of biofuel, and discuss actions policy makers may need to take to ensure global food security.

The trouble with crisis, however, is not simply the immediate catastrophe that earns the epithet.

Zionist Colonialism in Palestine (1965),2012,"Fayez Abdullah Sayegh (b. 1922–d. 1980) was born in Kharraba, Syria, where his father was a Presbyterian minister. Starting his studies at the American University of Beirut, he moved to the US and earned a PhD in philosophy from Georgetown University in 1949. He subsequently taught at the American University of Beirut, Yale, Stanford and Macalester College. Publishing widely on numerous topics pertaining to the Arab world, and the question of Palestine in particular, he became one of the foremost intellectuals and diplomats representing Palestine internationally. In 1965, he founded the Research Center of the Palestine Liberation Organization and served as a member of its Executive Committee. In this capacity, he edited and cultivated the main intellectual output of the 1960s revolutionary period in the Palestinian national movement, and was a foundational member of the diplomatic leadership of the movement. He served as the Chargé d’Affaires of the Arab States Delegations' Office at the United Nations. His most lasting legacy came on 10 November, 1975, when, as a delegate of Kuwait, he jointly authored and presented United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which determined Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. This Resolution would be revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86, a precondition set by Israel for its participation in the Madrid Conference. The following excerpts are from of his ‘Zionist Colonialism in Palestine’, which is possibly one of the clearest and most concise descriptions of its generation to discuss the organisational set-up of the Zionist settler colonial movement, its diplomatic strategies, as well as the ideology and structural features underpinning it. As a document of its time, it places Zionist settler colonialism in the context of European colonialism, and yet it distinguishes the Zionist project from other settler colonial movements. Sayegh does so by highlighting Zionism’s aspiration to racial self segregation, its rejection of any form of coexistence or assimilation, its unbending drive towards territorial expansion, and the necessary violence, structural and physical, it has to employ to achieve its goals. These phenomena are not passing features of Zionism, but, as Sayegh remarks, are ‘congenial, essential and permanent’, and consequently also manifest themselves in the policies of the Israeli state towards Palestinians and the wider Arab region. Palestinian resistance to Zionism has demanded many sacrifices, but, as Sayegh argues, these were not in vain, for ‘[r]ights undefended are rights surrendered’, and while the Palestinian nation lost its homeland, it did so ‘not without fighting’. ‘It was dislodged’, he notes, ‘but not for want of the will to defend its heritage’. However, he also argues, the threat emanating from Zionist settler colonialism, and the duty to challenge it, is not only the concern of Palestinians alone. Rather, a regional response to Zionism is necessary, given its constant threat to destabilise the region and wage wars on its neighbours. Likewise, it is also a challenge to anti-colonial movements everywhere, ‘[f]or whenever and wherever the dignity of but one single human being is violated, in pursuance of the creed of racism, a heinous sin is committed against the dignity of all men, everywhere’.

Morocco: A reformist monarchy?,2012,"This article argues that Morocco avoided revolution in 2011 because King Mohammed VI had already begun the long-term process of liberalizing the Moroccan state. This process began in 2004, when the king encouraged a state-sponsored inquiry into past governmental abuses of human rights. Then, in 2010, Mohammed began the process of transferring governmental decision-making authority from the central government to provincial governments. Although the mass protests that occurred in Morocco during 2011 were successful in inducing the king to accelerate constitutional reforms that devolved some of his power to the parliament, the king still retained his authority to appoint his preferred candidates to key ministries and remained in control of the army. Thus, Mohammed VI has created a process that is liberalizing the Moroccan polity but encourages controlled and gradual political evolution that avoids revolution. Within this evolutionary process, the king is still a fundamental aspect of the political system, relying on his symbolic political capital and Morocco's weak political party system to bolster his strength and weaken his political opponents.

"The water connection: Irrigation, water grabbing and politics in southern Morocco",2012,"Water and land grabbing is often an indication of growing control by an elite group over natural resources for agricultural production, marginalising their previous users. It may drive and exacerbate social, economic and political disparities and so increase the potential for conflict. In Southern Morocco's Souss valley, the overuse of water resources is causing aquifer levels to sink and agricultural land to be abandoned. At the same time, irrigated agriculture is still expanding, often permitting the growing of lucrative citrus fruits. This export-oriented agriculture mostly benefits the economic elite, increasing their political influence. Small farmers, on the other hand, face growing threats to their livelihoods. A public-private partnership (PPP) project reallocating water through a 90 km pipeline from a mountain region to plantations in the valley has been implemented to enhance water supply and save dying citrus plantations. However, it is accentuating disparities between farmers. We trace the dynamics of marginalisation linked to this PPP and use emerging water conflicts as a lens to analyse the appropriation of water resources and the underlying political and economic relationships and strategies. On the basis of the case study, we show that water conflicts are as much struggles over political influence as over the resource itself and, consequently, that the related phenomenon of 'water grabbing' is not only driven by economic interests but also determined by a political agenda of regime stability and economic control. However, we also point to the opportunities presented by recent social and political changes in Morocco, including the influence of the 'Arab Spring', and argue that such processes as increasing transparency, decentralisation and the empowerment of local civil society support, the re-appropriation of water, livelihoods and power. We conclude by examining the limits of this PPP model, which has been internationally praised by financial institutions, and calling for a careful evaluation of its ecological and social impacts before such experience is replicated elsewhere.","The water connection: Irrigation, water grabbing and politics in southern Morocco Water and land grabbing is often an indication of growing control by an elite group over natural resources for agricultural production, marginalising their previous users.

Second was the assumption that Islamists were the sole alternative to authoritarian regimes in the region. These uprisings also proved false the theory that democracy and civil and political rights were not priorities for peoples of the Arab world.

However, to date, little discussion has revolved around the role of long-standing assumptions about political change and human rights in the Arab world in prolonging the lifespan of these collapsing regimes. The first of these assumptions claimed that authoritarian rulers were the guarantors of stability in nations throughout the region. Second was the assumption that Islamists were the sole alternative to authoritarian regimes in the region. These uprisings also proved false the theory that democracy and civil and political rights were not priorities for peoples of the Arab world. Finally, the fourth assumption to be debunked is the claim that the people of the region are not ready for a democratic system that respects human rights because the religion of the majority-Islam-is incompatible with democratic values and human rights.

From terso into ultras: The 2011 Egyptian revolution and the radicalization of the soccer’s ultra-fans,2012,"Ultra-Fans have become a major aspect of global soccer fans’ culture. They have helped change the culture of the game and transform it from a cultural practice of the elite that was almost exclusively practiced in elite educational institutions during the second half of the nineteenth century into a distinct mass game by the first quarter of the twentieth century. Throughout the history of the game in Egypt, the Ultra-Fans’ culture has often been shaped and transformed in relation to the socio-economic and political conditions that have affected the nation in general and the lower classes in particular. Starting from the early 2000s, young fans of the popular Egyptian soccer clubs started forming their own Ultras groups. Most popular among these Ultras groups are the Ahlawi Ultras and the White Knights Ultras of the rival Carian clubs of the Ahli and the Zamalik respectively, the Yellow Dragon Ultras of the Isma’ili Club of the city of the Isma’iliah, the Green Eagles Ultras of the Massri Club of the city of Port Said, the Green Dragons Ultras of the Ithad Club of the city of Alexandria, and the Blue Devils Ultras of Ghazl al-Mahalah Club of the city of Ghazl al-Mahalah. With the outbreak of the 2011 revolution, the general disenchantment of the Ultras groups with politics turned into a direct engagement with politics, and the Ultras groups emerged as the most radical political force among the revolutionary forces on the scene.

The Arab Spring: Why the surprising similarities with the revolutionary wave of 1848?,2012,"Prominent scholars have highlighted important similarities between the Arab Spring of 2011 and the revolutions of 1848: Both waves of contention swept with dramatic speed across whole regions, but ended up yielding rather limited advances toward political liberalism and democracy. I seek to uncover the causal mechanisms that help account for these striking parallels. Drawing on my recent analysis of 1848, I argue that contention spread so quickly because many people in a wide range of countries drew rash inferences from the downfall of Tunisia's dictator. Applying cognitive heuristics that psychologists have documented, they overrated the significance of the Tunisian success, overestimated the similarities with the political situation in their own country, and jumped to the conclusion that they could successfully challenge their own autocrats. This precipitation prompted protests in many settings that actually were much less propitious; therefore problems abounded. Cognitive shortcuts held such sway because Arab societies were weakly organized and repressed and thus lacked leaders from whom common people could take authoritative cues. The decision whether to engage in emulative contention fell to ordinary citizens, who-due to limited information access and scarce experience-were especially susceptible to the simple inferences suggested by cognitive heuristics.

However, Arab authoritarian countries engage to different degrees in cooperation on democracy promotion, giving the EU more or less influence on domestic institutional change related to political participation, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. A comparison of domestic change and cooperation in Morocco and Tunisia in 2000-2010 shows that the EU has been instrumental in supporting and potentially reinforcing domestic reform initiatives. Yet the EU cannot trigger domestic institutional change in the first place. The degree of political liberalisation determines the fit between the domestic political agenda and external demands for reforms.

Our results show that the exports of goods from Egypt to the European Union decrease significantly in case of an appreciation of the Egyptian pound vis-à-vis the Euro, while the imports of Egypt from the EU increase to an even larger extent.

Yet, despite his expectations and that of most analysts, his regime proved susceptible to the Arab uprising. This article examines the causes and development of the Syrian uprising of 2011. It contextualizes the revolt by showing how the construction of the regime built in vulnerabilities requiring constant 'upgradings' that produced a more durable regime but had long term costs. It focuses on Bashar al-Asad's struggles to 'modernize' authoritarianism by consolidating his own 'reformist' faction, balancing between the regime's nationalist legitimacy and its need for incorporation into the world economy; his shifting of the regime's social base to a new class of crony capitalists; and his effort to manage participatory pressures through limited liberalization and 'divide and rule'. The seeds of the uprising are located in these changes, notably the abandonment of the regime's rural constituency and debilitating of its institutions. Yet, it was Asad's inadequate response to legitimate grievances and excessive repression that turned demands for reform into attempted revolution. The article then analyses the uprising, looking at the contrary social bases and strategies of regime and opposition, and the dynamics by which violence and foreign intervention have escalated, before finishing with comments on the likely prognosis.

The decolonised people, instead of enjoying the promised 'national liberation' and 'public liberties', discovered that the human rights they fought for were denied by the new political system. This section is followed by an overview of the post-independence state oppression marked by statist nationalist ideology as exemplified by the particular situation that characterised the political life in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. The fifth section of this paper focuses on the five members of the Union of the Arab Maghreb (UMA: Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) as parties to international human rights instruments, and committed, in principle, to enforcing them. The last theme to be addressed revolves around the human rights' record in North Africa between 2000 and 2008. ","['lby', 'dza', 'tun', 'mrt', 'mar']",GC,True,True,True,-1
Was the libya intervention necessary?,2011,"Qaddafi's death crystallizes the troubling features of the Libyan conflict. From a Libyan standpoint, the colonel's final moments exemplify the ambiguous relations between often unruly revolutionary fighters and the interim government, or National Transitional Council (NTC), casting doubt upon the latter's professed commitments to justice and reconciliation. The contradictory statements made by Libya's new leaders show the difficulty that the NTC, dependent financially and militarily on Western allies, faces in balancing national interest and international pressure. Qaddafi's macabre death also evokes the role of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary charges of crimes against humanity in March helped to give the military intervention the sheen of international legality. More generally, the killing of Libya's ex-leader raises the questions of whether the motivations behind the call for intervention were genuinely humanitarian and whether the intervention was necessary in the first place.","Was the libya intervention necessary?

Syria... the road to where?,2011,"In this article, drawn from a presentation at a seminar held at the Centre for Arab Unity Studies on 9 September 2011 in Beirut, veteran Syrian writer and political thinker Michel Kilo analyzes the situation on the ground in Syria in the midst of the 'Arab Spring', unrest and violent clashes between the state and various forces. The reforms President Bashar al-Assad initially mentioned when he replaced his father in the summer of 2000 - when he endeavoured to open up the country to a degree - were accorded low priority until the events of 2011 obliged his government to readdress them. Kilo argues that the Ba'athist ideology has long since been obsolete and ill suited to present realities, that regime priorities have been misdirected and that while the entrenched security apparatus is still a force to be reckoned with, genuine reforms are inevitable if a major catastrophe is to be averted. Gross income disparities and inequalities such as those the author details, which are intrinsic to the system, must be rectified; and in what is most germane in the present context, the Syrian middle class can no longer be placated or controlled through the typical strategies that the regime has historically employed. Syria at large, and especially the youth, has come to experience the wider virtual public space afforded by the internet and its social media websites, and they are eager to transfer the freedoms of cyberspace to the real political sphere. Kilo also asserts that there is a grave danger of civil war in the event that Syrians and the regime prove unable or unwilling to sort out their issues, and the presence of armed Islamist groups at the local level is a genuine threat where such are capable of drawing elements of the general population closer and into the sphere of radical political Islam if the regime continues its draconian tactics and opts for a 'security solution'. Kilo argues that Syrians themselves must rectify the situation and that foreign intervention will only ultimately play into the hands of the regime or the Islamists or both, and that such would be highly detrimental to the project of democratic transition via apparatuses of civil society in which Syrian intellectuals and the middle class play a vital role. Syria is at a precipitous crossroads - a breaking point - and Kilo, as an insider long affiliated with the Syrian intellectual opposition, provides essential reading for comprehending the players and dynamics of the crisis - one which will have serious implications for Lebanon and the rest of the region.

At the end, the legal problem how to transit from an authoritarian constitution to a more democratic one is discussed using the examples of Tunisia and Egypt.

The 'Arab Spring': Breaking the chains of authoritarianism and postponed democracy,2011,"While the events of the so-called 'Arab Spring' constitute movements of vast social significance within the Arab world, they have at the same time raised as many questions as they have hopes and expectations. Among the most pressing causes for concern and further research are the roles that Arab audiovisual media and satellite broadcasting have played in not only covering events, but also in possibly even fomenting them through selectivity, timing, high-technology decoupage of images culled from the internet and new forms of social media, as well as the introduction of themes and slogans into various Arab public arenas even before the locals have taken such up themselves. The connection of Arab media to the political agendas of their sponsors as in the case of Aljazeera, for instance, has also been brought to the fore and writ large, leading to questions over whether or not media discourse is dialogic and genuinely responsive to multiple voices in the sense envisioned by Habermas or whether it is a Machiavellian enterprise directed towards very specific political ends. The political role of the media and individual newscasters has assumed new dimensions during the course of the upheavals of the 'Arab Spring' where it has been difficult if not impossible to characterize the media as strictly a passive observer of events and not also an active participant in initiatives for 'democratic transition' and other. Finally, while previous incarnations of state control and censorship of Arab media have been diminished or shed outright in a number of Arab countries - including Egypt and Tunisia - there are questions about what sort of conditionalities new corporate sponsorship may evolve.

Factors that determine the amount and the speed of Libyan production increases include the degree of destruction of oil facilities and pipelines, the degree of exodus of critical specialized personnel and the conditions of their return or replacements, the degree of decisiveness or level of priority given by the transitional government. The financial crisis, the massive losses of certain ventures with global investment banks, and the uncertainty regarding the ability to reclaim all foreign assets make the amount of capital available significantly smaller than expected. Economic sanctions on Iran have contributed to the slow growth in production capacity during this period.

"From spectacle to spectacular: How physical space, social media and mainstream broadcast amplified the public sphere in Egypt's 'Revolution'",2011,"This study examines the impact of the media during the Egyptian uprising of 2011 and the extent that amplification occurred between the inter-related spaces of the physical (protests), the analogue (satellite television and other mainstream media) and the digital (internet and social media). Specifically, it analyses the intersection of these three spaces in what we label the 'amplified public sphere' and define as the information environment created when each space informs the other. Analysis begins by drawing on Bruce D'Arcus' notion of 'spectacles of dissent', in which activists renegotiate the visibility of the public sphere through protest and media networking. It then expands the concept, arguing that the Egyptian uprisings took it to the next level, transforming the 'spectacle' into a 'media spectacular', which globalised the public sphere through 24/7 coverage of what became an 'internationalised' physical space of Tahrir amplified by social media into mainstream blanket coverage. In analysis of a database of YouTube videos, the move from spectacle to spectacular was identified as coincident with a move from social media dominance to mainstream media amplification, even as the latter itself shifted how media was produced and consumed.

It then expands the concept, arguing that the Egyptian uprisings took it to the next level, transforming the 'spectacle' into a 'media spectacular', which globalised the public sphere through 24/7 coverage of what became an 'internationalised' physical space of Tahrir amplified by social media into mainstream blanket coverage. In analysis of a database of YouTube videos, the move from spectacle to spectacular was identified as coincident with a move from social media dominance to mainstream media amplification, even as the latter itself shifted how media was produced and consumed.

Neoconservatives and the Arab spring,2011,"Joshua Muravchik discusses whether neoconservatives will have to regret their wish for democratization in the Middle East. This was the very issue that thrust them into prominence in the early 2000s, and it gave neoconservatism a second after a decade of quiescence in the wake of the Cold War. The Bush administration adopted that position in the months after 9/11 and the president's 2002 National Security Strategy statement spelled it out. But 2005 and 2006 did not give democratization supporters much cause for hope. Israel will almost surely have to endure a less cooperative Egypt. And if the peace treaty is tampered with, that could be a terrible problem. But once this storm is weathered, there could be additional benefits. Finally, one must recall the original reason that neoconservatives and George W. Bush embraced the cause of democracy in the Middle East.","Neoconservatives and the Arab spring Joshua Muravchik discusses whether neoconservatives will have to regret their wish for democratization in the Middle East.

Creating a new transport vision for Egypt after revolution crisis,2011,"The 25th January 2011 revolution is a great event for Egypt as it passes through one of the most volatile moments of its history. The transport System in Egypt is on the threshold of entering a new era that needs huge efforts in order to cope with the new changes which are going to happen within Egyptian society. During the last three decades, the concentration of Wealth among political elites has distorted transport policies; serving in most cases the Private car users and not the public transport °nes, as the elite do not ride it. In addition, the uncoordinated land use and transportation Planning strategies, for decades, led to gigantic Population densities without adequate transport infrastructure and services. As a result, Egyptians use transport facilities beyond their design capacity. Best practice from other countries is needed in order to improve the transportation system in Egypt that would be considered as a locomotive which pushes the economic wheel forward. The European world has begun to promote efficient transportation modes for all standards of people. England is one of the pioneers in promoting a transportation system, which is able to meet the needs of the whole society to move freely, gain access, communicate, trade, and establish relationships without sacrificing other essential human or ecological values today or in the future. This paper summarizes the key trends in Egypt's transport system and travel behavior. It analyzes the extent and causes of the most complicated problems resulting from the disordered and false transportation strategies and policies in the past. Best practices from England in the transportation field will be introduced for the aim of developing possible policy improvements that would help in reducing the transportation crisis in Egypt. The paper identifies the trend of car ownership in Egypt as a result of the expected high growth in income. Finally, best lessons that can be learned from transport strategy and policy documents in developed countries are presented. The aim is not to provide a ready-made strategy document but to identify relevant questions and choices that need to be considered in preparing Egyptian Transport Strategies during the coming new promising era.","Creating a new transport vision for Egypt after revolution crisis The 25th January 2011 revolution is a great event for Egypt as it passes through one of the most volatile moments of its history.

The Transition of Egypt in 2011: A New Springtime for the European Neighbourhood Policy?,2011,"As we have witnessed in the first few weeks of 2011, the Tunisian and the Egyptian people have promoted a fundamental change in government and leadership within their countries. In the case of Egypt, the direction and likeliness of a deep societal democratization process are still unclear. The role and ability of foreign actors such as the European Union (EU) and its member states to support this process have so far not been shaped into a new political strategy of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Before the Arab revolutions of 2011, the foreign policy of the EU towards the Mediterranean countries was often characterized by the dilemma between the EU's stability and democratization goals. The change from the EMP to the ENP was assumed to imply a reorientation of EU foreign policy goals from a normative long-term oriented democratization to a strategic short-term stabilization of authoritarian systems on the Southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. This ambivalence of EU foreign policy is due to the environment of authoritarian rule and restrictions it has had to act within during the last few decades. The article will first give an empirical overview of the ENP policy towards Egypt. The empirical results show a multilayer policy of the EU, containing different goals and working with a combination of interest-based and normatively oriented tools. In this respect, the ENP towards Egypt mirrors the ambivalent objectives and ideas of the EU's role in the Southern Mediterranean. Secondly, the article will survey the first EU initiatives and actions after the revolution in Egypt. It will analyse the short-, medium- and long-term steps of the EU to support the starting process of democratic and economic transition and compare them with the existing ENP policies in order to identify commonalities and changes in the EU approach.

Strategy and contingency,2011,"The determination that strategy should have a long-term predictive quality has left strategy seemingly wanting when having to address what are currently called 'strategic shocks', such as the recent Arab Spring and the NATO commitment to Libya. The focus on grand strategy, particularly in the US, is responsible for this trend. Its endeavour to mitigate risk in the national interest is inherently conservative, rather than opportunistic, and it is favoured and probably required by powers that are committed to the status quo, that need to manage diminishing resources, and that are dealing with relative decline. Strategy as traditionally but more narrowly defined by generals for use in a military context, is much more exploitative and proactive. Precisely because it is designed to be used in war it presumes that its function is offensive, that it will have to deal with chance and contingency, and that its aim is change. Its task is to deal with the uncertainties of war, and to respond to them while holding on to long-term perspectives. Clausewitz addressed the issue of 'war plans' in book VIII of On war, but the thinker who did most to inject planning into European strategic thought was Jomini. His influence has permeated much of American military thinking. The effect of nuclear planning in the Cold War was to ensure that strategy at the operational level became conflated with broader views of grand strategy-not least when the Cold War itself provided apparent continuity to strategic thought. Since 1990 we have been left with a view of strategy which fails to respond sensibly to chance and accident. Strategy needs context, and a sense of where and against whom it is to be applied. Its core task is to embrace contingency while holding on to long-term national interests.

In hindsight, many of these informal activities clearly contributed to the December 2010-January 2011 nation-wide campaign, which eventually led to the Arab World's first bottom-up revolution ousting an unpopular and illegitimate ruler.

Arab Spring could impact RJ market prospects,2011,"Robert Wall states that the Arab Spring political turmoil in the Middle East can adversely impact the market prospects of Royal Jordanian (RJ) Airlines. The carrier has resumed flights to Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya after normalcy returned in that country to recover from the adverse impacts. The political conflict in the region has also adversely affected anticipated aircraft orders from carriers. Those activities are expected to reach an optimum level when airline management shifts from dealing with the immediate crisis to focusing on long-term development plans. Concerns are being expressed within the industry as to whether the movement will prove to be a prolonged depressant to air traffic due to political instability or a potential boon as larger elements of society become politically and economically enfranchised, making travel a more effective proposition.","Arab Spring could impact RJ market prospects Robert Wall states that the Arab Spring political turmoil in the Middle East can adversely impact the market prospects of Royal Jordanian (RJ) Airlines.

However, with the Egyptian revolts we see a challenge to the dominance of that resource and a desire to seek other resources as forces of mobilization.

A revolution for dignity and freedom: Preliminary observations on the social and cultural background to the Tunisian revolution,2011,"This paper seeks to explain the logic behind the Tunisian revolution, from the social protest which erupted in the governorate of Sidi Bouzid which then expanded to other regions - Kasserine, Douz, Jendouba and Sfax - until it evolved into a revolution which sparked off similar developments in other Arab countries. In this process, the self-immolation of a young informal trader, Mohamed Bouazizi, before the governorate in Sidi Bouzid, in protest at an official ban on his sales of fruit and vegetables, became the catalyst for this transformation, symbolising the issue of unemployment amongst youth, particularly amongst those with higher education. It also seeks to highlight the unfair socio-economic discrimination which existed between the interior and the coast in Tunisia, against the background of the general atmosphere of the lack of freedom of expression which lay behind the protests which ensued. However, these revolutionary events were not simply determined by the social and economical context but were also a response to highly rational calculations of how the abilities and resources of the different social classes directly affected by the former regime could be mobilised to achieve such a revolutionary outcome. Yet in attempting to assess this logic so soon after the events themselves, the author recognises the epistemological problems inherent in making such an assessment, both in terms of the interrelationships between events and in terms of participant observation of them.

Libya's Revolution,2011,"Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi's Libya was always supposed to be about people power. There was some irony, therefore, in the fact that the Qadhafi regime was brought to the brink of collapse by the sort of popular grassroots politics that the Libyan leader himself had rhetorically championed. Indeed, unlike the situation in Tunisia and Egypt, the Libyan rebellion appears to have resulted in a wholesale revolution. It was also more prolonged, and more violent. This paper explores three over-lapping factors to account for the difference between Libya and its neighbours. Firstly, the intense personalisation of politics in Libya ensured that, for the hardships and humiliations of the previous four decades, the buck stopped with Colonel Qadhafi himself. At the same time, the methodology of his long rule allowed for no chinks in the regime's armour - it had to be hegemony, or bust. Secondly, the fact that the colonel was able to adopt an iron-fisted approach to the demonstrators was linked, in important ways, to the tribal dynamics of his 'stateless state' - particularly those which underlay the security services. Finally, a pre-existing geographical tradition of resistance to centralised authority enabled the rebellion to develop as a credible force and sustain itself for six months, despite military setbacks. When the chips were down, Colonel Qadhafi could fall back on a small but robust network of (divided) tribal alliances, (divided) militias, (divided) regions and a (divided) family competing for his favour. Yet the divisions which he cultivated also provided succour to the millions of people who wished to oust him. The greatest challenge ahead for their representatives is to do away with informal spheres of power in Libya and to bring the political process out into the open.

Turning the gendered politics of the security state inside out?: Charging the police with sexual harassment in Egypt,2011,"This article analyzes sexual harassment politics in the global south as a crucial laboratory for testing and reformulating the mix of emancipatory and repressive governance practices that constitute contemporary gender-sensitive 'human security' regimes. In Egypt, between 2003 and 2010, internationalist feminist campaigns advocated anti-harassment projects that demonized working-class youth masculinities as well as 'disreputable' public femininities in an attempt to intensify the policing of the city and discipline public sociability. Through a politics of respectability and 'strange bedfellow' processes of NGO-ization, this state-allied, pro-enforcement project demobilized class-based movements for democratic change. By contrast, inventive Egyptian organizations adapted UN gender doctrines and legal mechanisms to their own purposes, mobilizing mass campaigns that critiqued frameworks of police protection and social respectability. They cultivated forms of assertive female agency that came to occupy center-stage during the recent Egyptian Revolution of January and February of 2011. By contrasting these forms of global/local feminist organizing, this article reveals the queering power of new metaphors of masculinity, class struggle and global female insecurity. The conclusion generates a critical theory of security-state practice and illuminates alternative global-south feminisms that contest rather than facilitate securitized and militarized appropriations of internationalist gender and security interventions.

"Racial myth, colonial reform, and the invention of customary law in Morocco, 1912-1930",2011,"Throughout the period of French indirect rule in Morocco (1912-56), colonial scholars and administrators generated a mass of literature to explain the perceived differences between Arab and so-called Berber (Amazeeri) societies. In the minds of many colonial enthusiasts, objective ethnic difference translated into a series of clear social, cultural, and political traits that had divided the indigenous populations for centuries. Historians of the period have highlighted this ethnographic focus as one of the preeminent justifications for French reforms in Morocco. The reform and institutionalisation of customary Berber law, which provoked the most widespread urban protest in nearly two decades, has long been understood as an example of legislative overreaching: the vibrant popular reactions to the so-called Berber dahir of 1930 signalled to many contemporary actors and subsequent historians the veritable birth of the Moroccan nationalist movement, as urban populations protested the what they saw as the diminution of the sultan's jurisdiction and the attenuation of shari'a in many rural areas. Implicit in this narrative is the idea that by 1930 the otherwise cautious and informed process of ethnically specific reform somehow went awry. This article seeks to demonstrate that the French legal reform program was, from its inception, founded upon vague, contested understandings of Berber social and political organisation that colonial administrators mobilised for very specific political ends. The so-called reform of Berber customary law was rather an invention of a system that French administrators used to remove the Berber population from the influence of the Arab makhzan, to marginalise religious law in favour of secular European values, and ultimately to fracture the network of social, cultural, and political relationships between the sultan and his people. Understanding the manipulative bases of legal reform sheds light on the relationship between the human sciences and colonial policy - specifically the complicated strength and malleability of scholarly mythmaking - and underscores the paradoxes of the French 'civilising mission'.

This means that the shift in the center of political gravity in the region from the Arab heartland comprising Egypt and the Fertile Crescent to what was once considered the non-Arab periphery - Turkey and Iran - which was becoming clearly discernible before the recent upheavals in the Arab world will continue. The shift in the strategic and political balance in the Middle East in favor of Turkey and Iran is the result of a combination of factors, some domestic, some regional and some global.","Beyond the Democratic Wave in the Arab World: The Middle East's Turko-Persian Future It is unlikely that the Egyptian revolution will have a major impact on the political and strategic landscape in the Middle East in the short and medium terms.

Egypt's rural-urban income disparity: Is the gap diverging?,2011,"Although some studies have attempted to assess the rural-urban income gap in the 1960s and 1970s, no study has focused on the evolution of the gap over the past 25 years, let alone the evolution in the real differences in per capita income between the rural sector and the urban one. The objective of this study is to fill the gap in the literature on this topic and to appraise the development in the gap - in nominal and real terms - both on the aggregate per capita rural and urban income levels and in different expenditure size classes from 1981 till 2005, a period which witnessed a revolution in the agricultural policies from intensive government intervention to complete liberalization. The results of the study prove that the gap diverged again from 1994 to 2005 after converging from 1981 to 1994. The study also proves that the gap is more apparent in the middle classes rather than the lower ones. Finally, with respect to food consumption the study concluded that a slight gap may exist in favour of rural - and not urban - Egypt. ","Egypt's rural-urban income disparity: Is the gap diverging?

At the maximum engagement end are Egypt and Iran. In both countries, as in Pakistan, one can reasonably refer to the existence of a “Military, Inc.” The Egyptian Ministry of Defense and its subordinate Ministry of Military Production preside over a sprawling economic empire that directly owns companies active in the industrial, agricultural, construction, telecommunications, and service sectors. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps presides over a similar economic empire that has particularly strong positions in the oil field service, construction, port operation, and media and telecommunications sectors. Both countries also have what might be described as parallel “officer economies.” These have come into existence as a result of officers, many of them retired, capitalizing on their regime connections by gaining ownership of privatized state-owned enterprises or by forming companies that thrive on state contracts. These two military economies are subject neither to the effective oversight of legislative or nonmilitary executive authority nor to the scrutiny of civil society, including the media. Both provide essential patronage resources to ensure the loyalty of their officer corps.

A Decline of Identity Politics,2011,"Religious actors and religious language are not absent from the Arab revolutions, but a striking feature of these movements is that they depart from Islamist identity politics, which tended to portray the problems of the Arab world as the result of Muslims’ betrayal of their religious identity. Slogans referencing Islam are remarkably few, even in contexts like Egypt where Islamist movements are an important organized political force. Similar to many Islamist activists, the youth who initiated these movements are exasperated by growing economic inequalities. Unlike the former, however, they do not feel the need to frame this issue in religious terms, but rather mobilize universal notions such as democracy, freedom, justice, and equality. This is the case even in societies with sharp religious divides such as Bahrain, where the overwhelmingly Shiʿi demonstrators oppose a Sunni-dominated regime. Regardless of whether the uprisings will succeed in achieving a genuine regime change, new political movements are likely to emerge that focus on political freedom and the reduction of social inequalities rather than projects maintaining Islam as a solution. The question remains whether this trend simply went unnoticed by the majority of the scholarly community working on the Middle East or whether it is something that emerged in the dynamics of the uprisings themselves. Either way, the phenomenon must now be analyzed. Does it mean a decline of the Islamist ideology? Will it permit an empowerment of existing liberal political movements? Of trade unionism?

Literature and Revolution,2011,"The three-week uprising in Egypt that ended with the removal of Husni Mubarak on February 11 happened to coincide with the section of my spring course syllabus on the Egyptian novel from Najib Mahfuz to Ahmed Alaidy. As was the case for many of my colleagues and their students, the rapid and awe-inspiring events unfolding daily before us pushed purely academic concerns to the margins of class discussion. This tidal wave of revolutionary politics erupting into the classroom forced me to the realization that my larger syllabus was not simply some neutral or systematic survey of half a century's worth of Arabic literature.

","Literature and Revolution The three-week uprising in Egypt that ended with the removal of Husni Mubarak on February 11 happened to coincide with the section of my spring course syllabus on the Egyptian novel from Najib Mahfuz to Ahmed Alaidy. As was the case for many of my colleagues and their students, the rapid and awe-inspiring events unfolding daily before us pushed purely academic concerns to the margins of class discussion. This tidal wave of revolutionary politics erupting into the classroom forced me to the realization that my larger syllabus was not simply some neutral or systematic survey of half a century's worth of Arabic literature.

The Arab revolutions for dignity,2011,"Before the historic revolts transforming the Arab world today, it was an article of faith that radical Islamist revolutionaries would spearhead any challenge to the dictatorships that rule the Arab world. The millions of prodemocracy protesters braving riot squads and regime thugs have demolished such preconceptions. Although much can still go wrong, the clamor for freedom and justice that started in the small town of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia and exploded in Liberation Square in Cairo has shown that the impossible can happen. The Islamist boogeyman has neither engineered the revolutions for dignity and freedom nor dominated them. The Obama administration has so far demonstrated a new realism that realizes the failures of the old foreign policy model that saw Arab tyrants as guarantors of America's interests in the region. The temptation to contain the revolutionary fervor spreading through the region still exists within the administration, but there is also a growing realization that the time has come for redefining America's role in the Middle East.

New episodes in Moroccan nationalism under colonial role: Reconsideration of Shakīb Arslān's centrality in light of unpublished materials,2011,"On the basis of hitherto unstudied materials, the article reconsiders the role of the Druze Prince Shakīb Arslān (1871-1946) on the spirit of Moroccan nationalism during the first half of the 20th century. It analyses one of the aspects of Arslān's life story on the basis of his correspondences with Muh{dot below}ammad Daoud (1901-1984), a prominent Moroccan nationalist leader, educationist and historian of his hometown Tetouan in Northern Morocco. These letters (approximately 150) are part of a bulky amount of Daoud's archival documents preserved by his daughter H{dot below}asnā Daoud in Tetouan. Their significance lies actually in their lively reflection of the spirit of vibrancy within Muslim nationalist movements in the inter-war period. The analysis of the Arslān-Daoud connection against the political background of Arslān's impact on North Africa will demonstrate the significance of family archives in the Muslim world, and their usefulness in filling the gap between the macro and micro levels for the understating of the religious and political interaction within East-West transnational networks in the inter-war period.

Evidence of North Africa's green revolution preserved in sedimentary organic matter deposited in three coastal lagoons,2011,"Because of longer residence times and limited mixing in coastal lagoons, the impacts of anthropogenic nutrient loading to lagoon food webs are often more pronounced than in other coastal ecosystems. For these reasons, many lagoons also provide an excellent environment for the deposition and accumulation of organic matter (OM). Sediment cores were retrieved from three North African lagoons to provide records of recent environmental changes. We measured percentage nitrogen (%N), nitrogen stable isotope values (δ 15N) , and percentage organic matter (%OM), and we used radiometric dating techniques ( 210Pb, 137Cs) to examine the evidence for the intensification of upstream agricultural practices in sediment cores from Lake Manzala (Egypt), Ghar El Melh Lagoon (Tunisia), and Lagune de Nador (Morocco). With the exception of one core collected near a sewage outfall, sediments from Lake Manzala clearly reflected the impact of agricultural intensification following completion of the Aswan High Dam and delta barrages in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. Both %N and %OM more than doubled in three Manzala sediment cores, and δ 15N values declined from 5% to <1%. These changes reflect the increasing use of synthetic fertilizers (δ 15N ≈ 0%) from the 1960s to the present. Sediments from Ghar El Melh show a similar trend, with %N more than tripling, %OM increasing by ∼50%, and δ 15N declining from 6% to 2% since 1965. These changes are consistent with the increasing use of water from a nearby river for crop irrigation and agricultural fertilizer use. Lagune de Nador receives relatively little agricultural drainage water, and core data did not show the same trends as Manzala and Ghar El Melh. Overall, the sediment core data from these systems reflect environmental shifts in the quantity, quality, and isotope signature of the deposited organic matter and confirm the concerns of local scientists and environmental managers that eutrophication has had dramatic impacts on the coastal ecosystems, particularly at the Egyptian and Tunisian sites.

The syrian opposition in the making: Capabilities and limits,2011,"Syria became the latest Middle Eastern country to join the chain of protests sweeping across the Middle East. The protests have since spread to several other cities with varying frequency and numbers, and the violent handling of the protests by the Syrian regime has created a protest movement, which has brought forth an array of demands from political reform to the fall of the regime. Opposition in different forms has always existed in Syria and among the Syrian diaspora. However, legal restrictions on social and political activities and the long-lasting atmosphere of fear, perpetrated by the Ba'ath Party and pervasive intelligence services, have so far limited the opposition's organizational capabilities. Despite difficulties and restrictions, the Syrian opposition is in the making. This paper presents a brief analysis of the opposition in Syria, surveys the opposition's fight for survival under the Ba'ath regime, and assesses its current strength and weaknesses.","The syrian opposition in the making: Capabilities and limits Syria became the latest Middle Eastern country to join the chain of protests sweeping across the Middle East.

Diversify or die,2011,"Sean Milmo explains how Middle East petrochemical companies need to think of diversifying to survive in the market. Petrochemical operators are having to diversify away from basic chemicals to more value-added products that can be differentiated in terms of quality and properties. The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt and the upheavals in the Arabian peninsula itself in the Yemen and Bahrain have focused the attention of the Gulf rulers on the need to restructure their economies so that they provide long-term, stable employment for a large. Political factors are evident in the supply and demand patterns of gas. Despite the relative wealth of the Gulf area, the price of electricity, which is generated mainly by gas-fired power stations, is heavily subsidized so that it does not reflect the full cost of production. The price of ethane, the main petrochemicals feedstock in the Gulf, is also kept artificially low.

Teaching journalism in oman: Reflections after the arab spring,2011,"Between 2005-2011, the New Zealand Tertiary Education Consortium (NZTEC) was contracted to the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) in the Sultanate of Oman. This long-term, long-distance off-shore education contract committed four New Zealand universities to providing degrees in four discipline areas (as well as English language support) within the Omani Colleges of Applied Science. As part of this process, AUT University’s Bachelor of Communication Studies was redeveloped for delivery in Oman. This case study will focus on the Journalism major and in particular the nature of the courses within this major, the difficulties encountered in redeveloping them and the challenge of delivering them under these particular circumstances in this particular time frame. The wider picture of the type of journalism practised in Oman; what is expected of—or indeed possible for― journalists in that society; and journalism as a force for democracy in Arab countries will also be briefly discussed.

Nonviolent revolution in the Middle East,2011,"The largely nonviolent pro-democracy insurrections that have swept the Arab world in recent months have succeeded in toppling dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, and (as of this writing) possibly Yemen.

The OSCE contribution to democratization in North African countries,2011,"The article focuses on a possible assistance of the OSCE to North African countries in political transition following the events of the so called 'Arab Spring'. The OSCE has extensive experience in relevant realms. It also has a long-standing institutionalized dialogue and co-operation with a number of North African states. The discussion within the Organization itself on what the OSCE could offer and with states such as Tunisia on their needs has began in January 2011, and is ongoing. The OSCE has also implemented first hands-on projects aimed at supporting the transitions processes in those countries, and linked to the on-going election processes there. But the OSCE Mediterranean dialogue suffers from the institutional context in which the Mediterranean Partners have the status akin to that of observers, and a certain lack of vision.

A lasting glow: Seizing the optimism of the Arab Spring,2011,"Jonathan Powell predicts how people will see the seeds of the Arab Spring spreading across the Middle East, with regime change on the way in Syria and possibly even Iran. The west should not rule out intervention if there is local and regional support for military action. The process is going to be difficult, with frequent setbacks, but the fact that the Arab peoples have begun to throw off long-established tyrannies is unalloyed good news for us and for them. They deserve our support, not least to avoid making the mistakes that bedevilled the countries of central and eastern Europe when they threw off the yoke of communist dictatorship. There were no democratic elections to let people change their governments peacefully and no freedom of expression to allow people to let off steam. The choice was between no change at all and revolution - and the people chose revolution.","A lasting glow: Seizing the optimism of the Arab Spring Jonathan Powell predicts how people will see the seeds of the Arab Spring spreading across the Middle East, with regime change on the way in Syria and possibly even Iran.

"The 'right to have rights': Active citizenship and gendered social entitlements in Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine",2011,"The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is now the subject of global attention with the escalation of social unrest and the toppling of dictators. The present article summarises the key findings of regional research on active citizenship, gender and social entitlements in Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine, zooming in on the role of the state and non-government organisations in channelling basic services to women and men. The present article argues that women are often remote from the state, and have their rights mediated and decided by social institutions (including families and communities) that do not necessarily recognise women's 'right to have rights'. The result is the failure of public institutions to deliver and secure women's entitlements. Whether this situation will change after the current revolutions in MENA remains debatable.
