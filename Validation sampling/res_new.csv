The samples were screened by microscopy and PCR for the Schistosoma species infection. A pair of degenerate primers were designed targeting partial regions in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene of S. mansoni and S. haematobium using real-time PCR-HRM assay. The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 31.8%; 23.8% of the participants were infected with S. haematobium and 9.3% were infected with S. mansoni. With regards to the intensity of infections, 22.1% and 77.9% of S. haematobium infections were of heavy and light intensities, respectively. Likewise, 8.1%, 40.5% and 51.4% of S. mansoni infections were of heavy, moderate and light intensities, respectively. The melting points were distinctive for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, categorized by peaks of 76.49 ± 0.25 °C and 75.43 ± 0.26 °C, respectively. HRM analysis showed high detection capability through the amplification of Schistosoma DNA with as low as 0.0001 ng/µL. Significant negative correlations were reported between the real-time PCR-HRM cycle threshold (Ct) values and microscopic egg counts for both S. mansoni in stool and S. haematobium in urine (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this closed-tube HRM protocol provides a potentially powerful screening molecular tool for the detection of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. It is a simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method. Hence, this method is a good alternative approach to probe-based PCR assays.",Yemen,['yem'],Yemen,['yem']

First it highlights the importance of accounting information in the economic development of developing countries, with a particular focus on the nation of Libya. Secondly, using the case of Libya's General Company for Pipelines (GCP), it demonstrates that the use of accounting information to achieve economic development goals is determined to a large extent by the political/ideological setting in which it is generated. The study is based on a literature review and archival research, reinforced by a qualitative case study comprised of interviews, attendance at meetings and a study of internal documents. A study of The General Company for Pipelines (GCP) revealed that frequent politically driven changes in the structure and number of popular congresses and committees severely limited the use of accounting information, relegating it to a formal role. In consequence, accounting information had litle effect on stimulating economic development in Libya.
  This study focuses on one case study which does limit generalisability. However, it also suggests fruitful research areas considering the historic factors which have determined the accounting role in developing and planned economies. By providing insights about social factors which have determined the use of accounting in a planned economy, this study has implications for similar economies as they move towards a more globalised mode of operations which enhance the role of accounting in meeting economic development needs.
  If devleoping countries are to harness the potential of accounting aid in the achievement of their development plans, the social and political setting in which accounting has been conducted needs to be understood.",Libya,['lby'],Libya,['lby']

Although several genetic studies have been carried out on certain regions of this area, it would be interesting to take advantage of additional global studies, including larger numbers of regions. In this paper we aim to expand previous genetic studies on populations from this area by investigating new populations and providing a global view based on the distribution of CD4 and FXIIIB Alu/STR (short tandem-repeat) compound systems. Haplotype frequencies of these two systems are determined in 352 DNA samples from Libya, Bahrain, and southern Iran. Comparative analyses and MDS plot representation show an evident genetic differentiation among the three population groups studied, i.e. North and South Mediterranean and Middle East. In addition, they assert the genetic richness and differentiation of Libya from other North African populations. Three haplotypes, CD4 90(+), FXIIIB 180(−) and CD4 110(−), were determined to be specific to Middle Eastern populations. The distribution of the two Alu/STR system haplotypes suggests that population movements between the North Mediterranean and Middle East are relatively less important than those involving the South Mediterranean with both the North Mediterranean and Middle East. However, the impact of these population movements is minimal compared to the long-standing settlement of the three population groups that have retained their genetic identity. Anthropological data thus obtained from the use of CD4 and FXIIIB Alu/STR compound systems would reflect the effect of advantages peculiar to these two systems. The determination of their haplotypes in more populations from the Middle East (particularly from the Arabian Peninsula) and from East Asia will provide more details on human evolutionary history.",Libya; Bahrain; Iran,"['bhr', 'irn', 'lby']",Libya;Bahrain;Iran,"['bhr', 'irn', 'lby']"

Nevertheless, the archaeological detection capability of this technology has so far not been fully assessed. This paper is a pioneering effort to assess the potential of satellite SAR X-band data in the detection of archaeological marks. We focus on the results obtained from a collaborative contribution jointly carried out by archaeologists and remote sensing experts in order to test the use of COSMO-SkyMed data in different contexts and environmental conditions. The methodological approaches we adopted are based on two different feature-enhancement procedures: (i) multi-temporal analysis performed to reduce noise and highlight archaeological marks; (ii) single-date analysis to assess the ability of the single SAR scene to detect archaeological features like with optical remote sensing. Results from multi-temporal data analysis, conducted using 40 scenes from COSMO-SkyMed X-band Stripmap data (27 February to 17 October 2013), enable us to detect unknown archaeological crop, soil, and shadow marks representing Luoyang city, dating from the Eastern-Han to Northern-Wei Dynasties. Single-date analyses were conducted using COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight scenes acquired for Sabratha (Libya) and Metapontum (southern Italy). These case studies were selected because they are characterized by diverse superficial conditions (desert and Mediterranean area) and archaeological marks (crop, soil and shadow). The results we obtained for both of them show that even a single SAR X-band acquisition is a feasible and effective approach for archaeological prospection. Overall, the methodological approach adopted demonstrated that both multi-temporal and single-date analysis are suitable for the enhancement of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental features.",Libya; Italy,"['ita', 'lby']",Libya; Italy,"['ita', 'lby']"

Traditionally travellers have chosen hubs like Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London or Paris as transfer points for trips to Asia. With the inauguration of non-stop services to places like Abu Dhabi, Doha or Dubai, new choices for air travellers have emerged. We analyse data derived from German air transport statistics on the effects of passenger flows between the airports of Düsseldorf and Hamburg to Asian destinations. They suggest that services introduced by Emirates stimulated passenger demand for Asian destinations, while incumbent hubs do not lose transfer passengers. Regarding travel times and connection quality of routings between secondary airports in Germany and Asian destinations, comparing routings of Emirates Airlines and Lufthansa suggests that due to geographic and scheduling constraints, services via Arabia do not constitute a perfect substitute for time-sensitive passengers.",Bahrain; Kuwait; Qatar; the United Arab Emirates; Oman; Germany,"['are', 'bhr', 'deu', 'kwt', 'omn', 'qat']",Bahrain; Kuwait; qatar; UAe; Oman;Germany,"['are', 'bhr', 'deu', 'kwt', 'omn', 'qat']"

Controlling space requires dominion. Organizing and administering space at reasonable costs demands authority and acquiescence. This conceptualization of geopolitics pertains to the underlying causes behind current instabilities in the Middle East as they link with broader geopolitical and strategic interests of great powers, particularly the US. Geopolitical theory helps offer deeper insights into how American decision makers are likely to think and act in the post-Cold War era, and in explaining, understanding, and possibly reading and forming expectations about US policies. It allows for more clarity in observing continuities in US strategy and in shaping expectations about tactics and policies in the service of its durable strategic international and global interests. The main argument of this paper is that the American ruling establishment, together with its supporting intellectual and military structures, persists in observing the emerging global venture geopolitically. In those terms much of what is occurring in the Arab region, more specifically in countries such as Syria among others, can be understood. It is also in those terms that one can conceptualize the American approach toward regional and world powers such as Iran, China and Russia.",US; Syria; Iran; China; Russia,"['chn', 'irn', 'rus', 'syr', 'usa']",usa;syria; Iran; China; Russia,"['chn', 'irn', 'rus', 'syr', 'usa']"

CD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ASPA enzyme. It has been reported with high frequency in patients with Jewish ancestry, and with low frequency in non-Jewish patients. This review will shed light on some updates regarding CD prevalence and causative mutations across the Arab World. CD was reported in several Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, and Tunisia. The population with the highest risk is in Saudi Arabia due the prevalent consanguineous marriage culture. In several studies, four novel mutations were found among Arabian CD patients, including two missense mutations (p.C152R, p.C152W), a 3346bp deletion leading to the removal of exon 3 of the ASPA gene, and an insertion mutation (698insC). Other previously reported mutations, which led to damage in the ASPA enzyme activities found among CD Arab patients are c.530 T>C (p.I177T), c.79G>A (p.G27R), IVS4+1G>T, and a 92kb deletion, which is 7.16kb upstream from the ASPA start site.

Materials and Methods: The study sample was comprised of 3003 children, attending schools in six governorates (cities and environs) in Yemen. For each subject, the standard demographic information such as gender and residency was collected, after which a questionnaire was used to determine the perception of occlusion and to assess the history of orthodontic treatment. Results: Of the whole, only 2.2% of the sample had some type of orthodontic treatment or consultation. Nearly 63.4% answered that they have aligned teeth, 29.7% have malaligned teeth, whereas 6.9% of them did not know whether they have aligned or malaligned teeth. Of the children who stated that they have malaligned teeth, 31.6% reported that they had crowded teeth, 15.5% had spaced teeth, 28.5% had protruded teeth and 24.3% had rotated and displaced teeth. Regarding the answers of the effect of malaligned teeth, 60.9% thought that it affects their appearance, 6.5% chewing, and 7.6% speech. The most common reasons for not seeking orthodontic treatment were ignorance about treatment, the thought that treatment is not important or not possible (61.1%) and having fear of pain or tooth extraction (23%). Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, almost 2% of the evaluated Yemeni school children had some type of orthodontic treatment or consultation, suggesting low perception level of the Yemeni children to their own occlusion.",Yemen,['yem'],Yemen,['yem']

Mollusc shells in Bwk and Bwkb horizons are dated to the period between 12.5 and 9.5 ka cal BP. The buried soils above (Ahb and ABwkb horizons), indicate a period of soil formation mainly between 8.8 and 8.3 ka cal BP. Between 8.3 and 6.7 ka cal BP more weakly developed soils occur, and those only locally. In contrast to the paleosols, sandy cover sediments (C horizons) without considerable signs of pedogenesis appear due to increasing aridity, wind activity, and sheet wash after 8.3 ka cal BP. These results indicate an arid climate and the formation of cover sediments at the desert margin of Yemen, in the rain shadow of the Yemen Highlands, after the main period of soil formation which ended around 8.3 ka cal BP, at the latest at 6.7 ka cal BP. Calculating from geochemical data a palaeoprecipitation of about 400 to 600 mm a− 1 (± 235 mm a− 1) from 12.5 to 8.3 ka BP is proposed.

The Yemen rift-related area is one of the most important provinces, being connected to the rifting processes of the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and Afar Triangle. In this paper, a review of the Yemen volcanic province and its relations with the Red Sea rifting are presented. Tertiary continental extension in Yemen resulted in the extrusion of large volumes of effusive rocks. This magmatism is divided in the Oligo-Miocene Yemen Trap Series (YTS) separated by an unconformity from the Miocene-Recent Yemen Volcanic Series (YVS). Magmas of the YTS were erupted during the synrift phase and correlate with the first stage of sea-floor spreading of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden (30 - 15 Ma), whereas the magmas of the YVS were emplaced during the post rift phase (10 - 0 Ma). A continental within plate character is recognized for both the YTS and YVS basalts. The YTS volcanic rocks are contemporaneous with, and geochemically similar to, the Ethiopian rift volcanism, just as the volcanic fields of the YVS are geochemically alike to most of the Saudi Arabian volcanics. YTS and YVS have analogous SiO2 ranges, but YVS tend to have, on average, higher alkalis and MgO contents than YTS. Fractional crystallization processes dominate geochemical variations of both series. Primitive magmas (MgO > 7.0%) are enriched in incompatible elements and LREEs with respect to primitive mantle, but YVS are more enriched than YTS. To first order, the different geochemical patterns agree with different degrees of partial melting of an astenospheric mantle source: 25% - 30% of partial melting for YTS and 10% - 3% for YVS. Secondly, the higher degree of enrichment in incompatible elements of YVS reflects also greater contribution of a lithospheric mantle component in their source region.",Yemen; Ethiopian; Saudi Arabian,"['eth', 'sau', 'yem']",Yemen,['yem']

Both crisis-affected communities and global volunteer networks are becoming increasingly digital. This means that the former are increasingly the source of relevant crisis information, while the latter are becoming more adept at managing and visualizing this information on live crisis maps. This article introduces the field of crisis mapping and provides key examples from Haiti, Russia, Libya, and Somalia to demonstrate how digitally empowered affected communities and volunteer networks are reshaping humanitarian response in the twenty-first century.",Haiti; Russia; Libya; Somalia,"['hti', 'lby', 'rus', 'som']",Haiti; Russia; Libya; Somalia,"['hti', 'lby', 'rus', 'som']"

Acceleration sensor calibration is a potential source of error. This study aims to describe and evaluate an autocalibration method to minimize calibration error using segments within the free-living records (no extra experiments needed). The autocalibration method entailed the extraction of nonmovement periods in the data, for which the measured vector magnitude should ideally be the gravitational acceleration (1 g); this property was used to derive calibration correction factors using an iterative closest-point fitting process. The reduction in calibration error was evaluated in data from four cohorts: UK (n = 921), Kuwait (n = 120), Cameroon (n = 311), and Brazil (n = 200). Our method significantly reduced calibration error in all cohorts (P < 0.01), ranging from 16.6 to 3.0 mg in the Kuwaiti cohort to 76.7 to 8.0 mg error in the Brazil cohort. Utilizing temperature sensor data resulted in a small nonsignificant additional improvement (P > 0.05). Temperature correction coefficients were highest for the z-axis, e.g., 19.6-mg offset per 5°C. Further, application of the autocalibration method had a significant impact on typical metrics used for describing human physical activity, e.g., in Brazil average wrist acceleration was 0.2 to 51% lower than uncalibrated values depending on metric selection (P < 0.01). The autocalibration method as presented helps reduce the calibration error in wearable acceleration sensor data and improves comparability of physical activity measures across study locations. Temperature ultization seems essential when temperature deviates substantially from the average temperature in the record but not for multiday summary measures.",UK; Cameroon; Brazil; Kuwait,"['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']",UK; kuwait; Cameroon; Brazil,"['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']"

To understand the levels and partitioning of genetic variation across populations and geographical regions of this species, we assessed its genetic diversity using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers.Fourteen ISSR primers selected from 43 primers gave rise to 211 amplified loci, of which 68 were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) at the population level ranged from 17.1 to 23.7%, with an average of 21.3%. Nei's gene diversity (h) and Shannon's information index (I) were 0.086 and 0.125, respectively. At the species level, PPL was 32.2%, while h and I were 0.116 and 0.172, respectively. A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance revealed a high level of genetic differentiation among populations (17% of total variance, P = 0.001), consistent with the gene differentiation coefficient (G ST = 0.256). Nevertheless, the evaluated genetic diversity was very low within populations; while relatively high among populations, levels were insufficient for long-term survival. Saudi Arabian accessions were also compared to accessions of a population from Yemen, where the species is more widespread. The Yemeni population also showed low genetic diversity but clustered separately.Breonadia salicina in Saudi Arabia is characterized by low within-population genetic diversity and high among-population genetic differentiation.

After some time, when aiming for groundwater recharge, the infiltration equals inflow and thus forms a kind of “standing” wave. The numerical solution of such phenomena generally involves considerable problems. For avoiding the numerical inconvenience resulting from the complex interacting surface/subsurface flow, we present an analytical solution of the slightly modified zero-inertia (ZI) equations. The development introduces a momentum-representative cross section for portraying the transient development of momentum and refers to a channel with constant slope, irregular geometry, and a permeable channel bed with significant infiltration. Due to the structure of the solution, any arbitrary infiltration model can be used for quantifying the infiltration losses. For both synthetic prismatic and nonprismatic test channels, the robust and easy-to-use analytical ZI model shows an excellent match with the results of a comparative numerical simulation. Finally, the ZI model is employed for simulating a surge flow downstream of the Wadi Ahin groundwater recharge dam (Oman), in order to perform a scenario for artificial groundwater recharge in a natural wadi channel reach. This realistic application illustrates the potential of the new approach by even computing an almost standing wave and shows its applicability for an accurate and robust evaluation of release strategies.",Oman,['omn'],Oman,['omn']

BC incidence varies geographically, highest in Western Europe and lowest in Africa. BC in females is strongly correlated to age, the highest incidence rate amongst older women reinforcing the importance of hormonal status. BC in young females has an aggressive phenotype. There is a shared observation amongst practicing oncologists that BC in Middle East and the developing world presents at an earlier age. Aim and Objective: The aims of this study are to evaluate the age at presentation of female BC in Oman, and to compare our data with international and regional published data. It discusses the impact of young age Breast Cancer. Materials and Methods: All diagnosed female BC cases registered from 1996-2010 all over the country, were retrieved from the National Cancer Registry, Ministry of Health. BC cases were analyzed with respect to age at presentation. The data were compared with regional and international data. Results: A total of 14,109 cancer cases were recorded during the period of study. BC was the leading malignancy as 1,294 cases (9.1%). Female BC patients were 1,230; denoting 19.2% of all female cancers. 53.5% of female BC presented below 50 years of age. Male BC constituted 5% of total, with 67% of male BC occurring over 50 years of age. Compared with data from Oman, the highest rates in UK and other Western countries are above 50 years of age. These rates are four to 10 times higher than local in different age groups. Interestingly, these rates increase with increasing age in UK from 40-45 to up to 85+, keep on increasing and go up to four times higher with higher age. This phenomenon, of increasing incidence rates with age, is not observed in our local population. Discussion: BC is significantly correlated to age as reported from Western population. BC is reported at a younger age from developing and Arab World, which need to be further studied and validated. This phenomenon of BC in younger age may have significant implications and effects ranging from screening, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and cost of treatment. Conclusion: The impact on young women diagnosed with BC is enormous, ranging from psychosocial to healthcare services and economics. There is a need to study it further in depth in developing World.",Oman; UK,"['gbr', 'omn']",Oman; Uk,"['gbr', 'omn']"

Initially identified in samples collected in 2003 from Iran, during 2005 and 2006 this FMDV lineage (proposed to be named A-Iran-05) spread into Saudi Arabia and Jordan and then further west into Turkey reaching European Thrace in January 2007. Most recently A-Iran-05 has been found in Bahrain. To the east of Iran, it has been recognized in Afghanistan (2004–07) and Pakistan (2006–07). Throughout the region, this lineage is now the predominant genotype of FMDV serotype A sampled, and has appeared to have replaced the A-Iran-96 and A-Iran-99 strains which were previously encountered. In August 2007, a new A-Iran-05 sub-lineage (which we have called A-Iran-05ARD-07) was identified in Ardahan, Turkey, close to the border with Georgia. This new sub-lineage appeared to predominate in Turkey in 2008, but has, so far, not been identified in any other country. Vaccine matching tests revealed that the A-Iran-05 viruses are antigenically different to A-Iran-96 and more like A22.

Ensemble learning has evolved to be very effective approach to enhance the performance for many applications through integration of different models. In spite of this advantage, the use of ANN‐based ensembles in mode choice modeling is under explored. The focus of this study is to investigate the use of aforementioned techniques for different number of transportation modes and predictor variables. This study proposes a logit‐ANN ensemble for mode choice modeling and investigates its efficiency in different situations. Travel between Khobar‐Dammam metropolitan area of Saudi Arabia and Kingdom of Bahrain is selected for mode choice modeling. The travel on this route can be performed mainly by air travel or private vehicle through King Fahd causeway. The results show that the proposed ensemble gives consistently better accuracies than single models for multinomial choice problems irrespective of number of input variables.

The character of the movements at the heart of the revolts, and the speed with which they despatched four autocratic leaders from office, raise questions of the most basic kind about the relationship between ruler and ruled in North Africa and the Middle East. This article explores such questions following events in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen. It argues that the closure of political systems combined with socio-economic distress to stimulate broad demands for regime change. New movements mobilised largely without formal institutional structures, using new communication tools, and evaded the repressive apparatus of the state. However, the novel character of these movements limited their potential to exploit the political openings they created. Indeed, the post-revolutionary setting is one in which the dominant theme is the return of the ‘old’: established elites, including Islamists, who are reasserting their interests and are well-positioned to secure advantage.",Tunisia; Egypt; Yemen,"['egy', 'tun', 'yem']",Tunisia; Egypt; Yemen,"['egy', 'tun', 'yem']"

The interpretation and analysis of the lineaments indicate that the Jifara Plain is controlled by three main fault systems, trending northwest-southeast, east-west, and northeast-southwest. The three trends represent the remnants of reactivated structures that formed under the stress regimes generated during the tectonic evolution of North Africa. The magnetic data reveal three northwest- and northeast-trending sedimentary basins in the study area. The depth of the basement inside the main basin ranges from 1 to 5 km.

A particularly low level of cpDNA polymorphism was detected; but, in a recent study based on 14 Mediterranean trees, an intergenic (trnD-trnT) spacer was reported to be sufficiently variable to distinguish at least six haplotypes in cultivated olive. Compared to previous studies, the level of polymorphism described (nine substitutions and seven short indels on a segment of approx. 1 kbp) was particularly high. In order to enlarge upon the sample analysed, new trnD-trnT sequences were generated from 18 olive trees originating from the Mediterranean Basin, Macaronesia, S. Algeria, Kenya, Yemen, Reunion Island, Hawaii, Iran, and China. Only two base substitutions were detected in this enlarged sample, one of which discriminated between Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and other olive sub-species. Length variation at a (poly-T) microsatellite motif was also found. The relatively low variation revealed between distant populations of olive suggests that sequencing problems might be the origin of the high polymorphism previously reported in the trnD-trnT spacer. Furthermore, length polymorphism at the poly-T motif was investigated in 55 Mediterranean olive trees which had previously been analysed for other cpDNA polymorphisms. Two alleles were found in Mediterranean olive, but they did not permit detection of new cpDNA haplotypes. It is proposed that proper analyses of cpDNA polymorphism in Mediterranean olive should use a combination of seven markers in order to detect its correct phylogeographic structure.",Algeria; Kenya; Yemen; Iran; China,"['chn', 'dza', 'irn', 'ken', 'yem']",Algeria; Kenya; Yemen; Iran;China,"['chn', 'dza', 'irn', 'ken', 'yem']"

A total of 28 semi-structured interviews were carried out with a range of LCB stakeholders comprising preparers of financial statements, users, regulators and academics. A questionnaire survey of stakeholders which yielded 102 Responses (response rate 53%) was also carried out. A variety of views were held which varied to some extent according to stakeholder group. A widely held perception amongst interviewees was that the auditor has the ability to detect EM practices but may not be able to prevent it. However questionnaire respondents were, in aggregate, more confident of the auditor’s ability to deter EM due to the influence of the audit report. The paper provides insights into stakeholders’ perceptions of the quality of bank audits. The findings are of particular relevance to regulators, and specifically, the Central Bank of Libya. Perceptions of audit quality raise questions about its guidance and regulations especially in connection with audit firm rotation. Perceptions of audit quality, and therefore, of the credibility of financial statements should be of interest to all stakeholders. The importance of the banking sector for society has been amply demonstrated in recent years. A well-functioning audit function is a key component of its regulation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine issues related to banks’ audit quality and audit firm rotation in Libya.",Libya,['lby'],Libya,['lby']
https://openalex.org/W2782385051,2018,Computer Science,with_mention_arab,Comparison of two sensor technologies for solar irradiance measurement in a desert environment,"Using 24 months of 1-min radiometric measurements conducted at two remote arid sites in Kuwait, the impact of sensor technology (thermopile vs. photodiode with rotating shadowband) on the magnitude of the three components of solar irradiance (global, direct and diffuse) is analyzed. The deviations (photodiode minus thermopile) are typically affected by both sun zenith angle and irradiance magnitude. For the global and direct components, most deviations (91% in the case of GHI, 87–91% in the case of DNI, depending on site) are within ±5%, and can thus be considered satisfactory. Larger deviations in direct and global irradiance are typically found under low zenith angles (summer conditions). The main source of concern is the negative bias and intricate pattern found in the diffuse deviations, most of the time. Only 46–61% of the deviations (depending on site) are within ±5%. The diffuse issue seems to be caused by an insufficient spectral correction of the diffuse reading. The so-called “cat ear” angular issue (a sudden spike in sensitivity for an angle of incidence ≈80°, combined with a sudden drop in sensitivity beyond ≈85°) is also still present in the direct and global irradiance measurements under clear conditions. The present results underline the imperfect nature of the empirical corrections typically applied to photodiode instruments to improve their irradiance estimates. Nonetheless, the deviations observed here are sufficiently low in general to guarantee good resource assessments, even under harsh and variable desert conditions, to the condition that the photodiode instruments are properly calibrated on site during periods whose atmospheric conditions are representative of the whole year, and their readings are duly corrected with the best possible algorithms.",Kuwait,['kwt'],Kuwait,['kwt']

The Zionist movement had two different motives for supporting aliya: Diaspora Jews’ need for a safe haven (which would require mass aliya), and the need to build a solid and stable Jewish society in mandatory Palestine/Israel (which would require selective aliya).When Ben-Gurion, in the 1940s, came to favour mass aliya, he did so because of the immigrants’ potential contribution to the attainment of statehood and then the independent state.In the first years after independence, when entire communities immigrated to Israel, they included old and infirm people who did not fit the image of the pioneers of pre-state aliya. Nevertheless, for Ben-Gurion, their demographic contribution outweighed the burden of their absorption. By 1952, he had changed his mind and became one of the strongest supporters of selective immigration. He continued to support selectivity even when, in 1955, the safety of Moroccan Jews and their freedom to emigrate was in jeopardy. Ben-Gurion's attitude to aliya from Morocco, in the shadow of the Czech-Egyptian arms deal, reflected his priority – a strong and secure Israel.",Israel; Palestine; ,"['isr', 'pse']",Israel; Palestine; Morocco,"['isr', 'mar', 'pse']"

Data was generated through one to one, in-depth interviews and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.Results: Three main themes emerged from the data: (1) the burden of care, (2) comforts, and (3) coping. The findings showed that the lived experience of home caregiving includes physical, emotional and financial burdens, combined with a lack of professional support. The collective experience was infused with intense emotions because of a lack of structured support, resulting in negative emotions that frequently affected the caregivers’ well-being and their ability to care for the ill person. Nevertheless, caregivers tried to maintain care and comforts for their terminally ill relative in the home. They adopted the home environment, arranged resources to ease caring and provided psychological care. Caregivers utilized three coping mechanisms, faith, personal strategies and distribution of the care responsibilities among family members.Conclusions: Caregivers were not prepared for the commitment and burdens of home care when a family member is terminally ill. A recommendation from the study findings is that training be offered on nursing care before patients discharge. In addition, a reactivation of the palliative care clinic hotline service would support family caregivers. A further recommendation is that home nursing care and hospice services be established to improve homecare services for family caregivers in Bahrain.",Bahrain,['bhr'],Bahrain,['bhr']

Materials and Methods: A total of 41 ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains were collected from clinical samples of inpatients and outpatients from Sana'a (Yemen) from January to December 2013. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sequencing were used for detection of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target genes gyrA and parC. Genetic relatedness of E. coli isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). O25b/ST131 clone detection was performed using polymerase chain reaction of O25b rfb and allele 3 of the pabB gene and by a multilocus sequence typing. Results: All E. coli isolates contained the aac(6')Ib-cr gene associated with blaCTX-M-15 and qnrS genes in 63.4% and 12.2%, respectively. A rate of 36.6% (15/41) of O25b/ST131 E. coli isolates were identified belonging to the H30-Rx subclone producing both CTX-M-15 and Aac(6')Ib-cr enzymes and carrying two substitutions in GyrA (Ser83Leu/Asp87Asn) and two substitutions in ParC (Ser80Ile/Glu84Val).

Redefining migrant and refugee host state engagement options in Mediterranean ‘transit’ countries","What determines policies toward migrants and refugees in the transit-turned-host countries? Compared to the vast literature examining migration to Europe and North America, we know relatively little about why ‘newer’ host states pursue a liberal strategy with access to residency, employment and services on par with citizens, or what drives them to treat migrants and refugees with exclusion. This paper argues that there is a third choice: the idea of indifference-as-policy. Indifference refers to indirect action on the part of the host state, whereby a state defers to international organisations and civil society actors to provide basic services to migrants and refugees. The paper uses data collected over two years in Egypt, Morocco and Turkey to examine how this tripartite understanding of engagement maps onto empirical reality. Drawing on this analysis, the argument in this paper is two-fold. First, indifference is a strategic form of engagement utilised by host states, and that it creates a specific type of environment that allows for the de facto integration of migrants and refugees. Second, even when host states take steps toward a more liberal engagement strategy, examining policy outcomes, rather than outputs, demonstrates that indifference is still the dominant policy.",Egypt; Morocco; Turkey,"['egy', 'mar', 'tur']",Egypt; Morroco; Turkey,"['egy', 'mar', 'tur']"

Design Secondary analysis of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted 2005–2015. Child stunting and anaemia were defined using current WHO classifications. Sociodemographic characteristics of children with anaemia, stunting and co-morbidity of these conditions were compared with those of ‘healthy’ children in the sample (children who were not stunted and not anaemic) using multiple logistic models. Setting Low- and middle-income countries. Subjects Children aged 6–59 months. Results Data from 193 065 children from forty-three countries were included. The pooled proportion of co-morbid anaemia and stunting was 21·5 (95 % CI 21·2, 21·9) %, ranging from the lowest in Albania (2·6 %; 95 % CI 1·8, 3·7 %) to the highest in Yemen (43·3; 95 % CI 40·6, 46·1 %). Compared with the healthy group, children with co-morbidity were more likely to be living in rural areas, have mothers or main carers with lower educational levels and to live in poorer households. Inequality in children who had both anaemia and stunting was apparent in all countries. Conclusions Co-morbid anaemia and stunting among young children is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, especially among more disadvantaged children. It is suggested that they be considered under a syndemic framework, the Childhood Anaemia and Stunting (CHAS) Syndemic, which acknowledges the interacting nature of these diseases and the social and environmental factors that promote their negative interaction.",Yemen; Albania,"['alb', 'yem']","Albania; Ye,em","['alb', 'yem']"

Components of variance for the random effects (mixed model) were estimated by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) methodology. Sires were evaluated for the TMY by three methods, Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) using Harvey program, Transmitting Ability (TA) according to the Least Square Means of sire progeny (TALSM) and according to Means (TAM). Results showed that TMY and DP were affected significantly (P &lt; 0.01) by all factors except season of calving and age at first calving, while LL was affected significantly (P&lt; 0.01) only by year of calving and parity. The averages of the TMY, LL, and DP were 3919.66 kg, 298.28 days, and 114.13 days respectively. The corresponding estimates of heritability (h²) were 0.35, 0.06, and 0.14 respectively. The highest and lowest BLUP values of sires for the TMY were – 542.44 kg and 402.14 kg, while the corresponding estimates for TALSM and TAM were – 470.38, 380.88 kg and – 370.12, 388.50 kg respectively. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients among BLUP, TALSM and TAM ranged from 0.81 to 0.67. These results provide evidence that the selection of sires will improve the TMY in this herd because of the wide differences in genetic poetical among sires, and a moderate estimation of heritability.",Yemen,['yem'],Yemen,['yem']

One hundred Campylobacter jejuni strains of human and poultry origin isolated in 2002-2003 (phase A) and 2005-2006 (phase B) in the Kingdom of Bahrain were evaluated. Susceptibility to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was determined, and plasmid extraction and polymerase chain reaction detection of the tet(O) gene was carried out. A single erythromycin-resistant isolate was identified, in sharp contrast to the high ciprofloxacin resistance which also showed an increment in phase B. Tetracycline resistance was higher in chicken (80.9%) compared to human (41.3%) isolates (P < 0.01). Most isolates harbored two plasmids (23 kb and 35 kb) with significant correlation between tetracycline resistance and plasmid carriage in chicken isolates. The findings show continued effectiveness of erythromycin for campylobacteriosis but an increasing trend of high ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance. Tetracycline resistance is most likely due to the transfer of plasmids carrying the tet(O) gene between isolates.",Bahrain,['bhr'],Bahrain,['bhr']
