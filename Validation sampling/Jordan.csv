Experimental methods used for characterizing epitopes are time consuming and demand large resources. The availability of epitope prediction method(s) can rapidly aid experimenters in simplifying this problem. The standard feed-forward (FNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been used in this study for predicting B-cell epitopes in an antigenic sequence. The networks have been trained and tested on a clean data set, which consists of 700 non-redundant B-cell epitopes obtained from Bcipep database and equal number of non-epitopes obtained randomly from Swiss-Prot database. The networks have been trained and tested at different input window length and hidden units. Maximum accuracy has been obtained using recurrent neural network (Jordan network) with a single hidden layer of 35 hidden units for window length of 16. The final network yields an overall prediction accuracy of 65.93% when tested by fivefold cross-validation. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction values are 67.14, 64.71, and 65.61%, respectively. It has been observed that RNN (JE) was more successful than FNN in the prediction of B-cell epitopes. The length of the peptide is also important in the prediction of B-cell epitopes from antigenic sequences.

But such Julia components may arise for rational maps. The first example is due to Curtis T. McMullen who provided a family of rational maps for which the Julia sets are Cantor of Jordan curves. However, all known examples of buried Julia components, up to now, are points or Jordan curves and comes from rational maps of degree at least five. This paper introduces a family of hyperbolic rational maps with disconnected Julia set whose exchanging dynamics of postcritically separating Julia components is encoded by a weighted dynamical tree. Each of these Julia sets presents buried Julia components of several types: points, Jordan curves, but also Julia components which are neither points nor Jordan curves.

Elsewhere, T. nilotica seems to be more abundant than T. aurea. The affinities of T. aurea may be with T. mossambica, which exists without T. nilotica in the eastward-flowing rivers of Africa, but this species has a finer dentition in jaws and pharynx and a characteristic hypertrophy of the jaws and snout in the breeding male.",,,"['sen', 'isr']","['sen', 'ner', 'tcd', 'isr']",,,"['sen', 'isr']","['sen', 'ner', 'tcd', 'isr']",False,"['isr', 'sen']","['isr', 'ner', 'sen', 'tcd']"

Callaghan adopted a pro-Israeli stance, cultivating close relations with the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and defending Begin’s position over key issues, particularly his reluctance to remove settlements from the occupied territories. In this respect Callaghan’s government departed from established British policy, even abstaining over United Nations Security Council resolution 446 in March 1979 which condemned continuing Israeli settlement activity.

Growth of B japonicum strain E109 was not affected by this herbicide even when exposed to concentrations 150 times higher than recommended field doses. However, nodulation of soybean plants treated 5 days after emergence with chlorimuron‐ethyl at standard application rates was impaired: a 38% decrease in the number of nodules per plant was observed four weeks after treatment. Despite nodule number decrease, no changes in shoot nitrogen content could be detected. Total fresh biomass was diminished by 25% in herbicide‐treated plants. Leghemoglobin content in nodules did not vary; nevertheless total nodule protein was diminished by 40% in the herbicide‐treated group. ALS activity in different soybean tissues and their relative sensitivity to chlorimuron‐ethyl were also investigated. Roots and bacteroids had the greatest specific ALS activities. On a fresh weight basis, the bacteroid fraction displayed the highest ALS activity and was also the most tolerant to in vitro chlorimuron addition: 72% of its activity was retained after including 10 µ M chlorimuron‐ethyl in the reaction mixture. These results indicate that standard application rates of chlorimuron‐ethyl will have limited incidence on B japonicum survival, and effects on nodulation may have little long‐term consequences on soybean nitrogen fixation potential. The differences found among soybean tissues not only in intrinsic ALS activity but also in their relative sensitivity to this herbicide suggests that, in leguminous plants living in symbiosis with rhizobia, nodules may contribute to an enhanced tolerance to ALS inhibitors.

This is proved by explicit construction of a new inner product employing a ""quasi-fermion"" algebra in momentum space where creation and annihilation operators are not related via Hermitian conjugation. For a special example, when the boundary fields lie on the imaginary axis, we show the spectral equivalence of the quasi-Hermitian XX spin-chain with a non-local fermion model, where long range hopping of the particles occurs as the non-Hermitian boundary fields increase in strength. The corresponding Hamiltonian interpolates between the open XX and the quantum group invariant XXZ model at the free fermion point. For an even number of sites the former is known to be related to a CFT with central charge c=1, while the latter has been connected to a logarithmic CFT with central charge c=-2. We discuss the underlying algebraic structures and show that for an odd number of sites the superalgebra symmetry U(gl(1|1)) can be extended from the unit circle along the imaginary axis. We relate the vanishing of one of its central elements to the appearance of Jordan blocks in the Hamiltonian.",['-'],,['-'],,,,['-'],['-'],True,[],[]

Here, we report the genome sequence of this pathogen and 7,863 identified protein-coding genes, and we show that the majority of clinical isolates possess high levels of allelic diversity, genetic admixture, heterozygosity, and extensive aneuploidy. By utilizing paired genome-wide high-throughput DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) with RNA-seq, we found that gene dosage, at the level of individual genes or chromosomal “somy” (a general term covering disomy, trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.), accounted for greater than 85% of total gene expression variation in genes with a 2-fold or greater change in expression. High gene copy number variation (CNV) among membrane-bound transporters, a class of proteins previously implicated in drug resistance, was found for the most highly differentially expressed genes. Our results suggest that gene dosage is an adaptive trait that confers phenotypic plasticity among natural Leishmania populations by rapid down- or upregulation of transporter proteins to limit the effects of environmental stresses, such as drug selection. IMPORTANCE Leishmania is a genus of unicellular eukaryotic parasites that is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases that range from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) to life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Developmental and strain-specific gene expression is largely thought to be due to mRNA message stability or posttranscriptional regulatory networks for this species, whose genome is organized into polycistronic gene clusters in the absence of promoter-mediated regulation of transcription initiation of nuclear genes. Genetic hybridization has been demonstrated to yield dramatic structural genomic variation, but whether such changes in gene dosage impact gene expression has not been formally investigated. Here we show that the predominant mechanism determining transcript abundance differences (&gt;85%) in Leishmania tropica is that of gene dosage at the level of individual genes or chromosomal somy.","['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']",,"['irq', 'jor', 'syr']",,,,"['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']","['irq', 'jor', 'syr']",False,"['irq', 'jor', 'syr']","['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']"

In the USA and theUK, involuntary treatment has its rootsin early government attempts to care forthose who could not, or would not, carefor themselves. According to Boyle(2002), government assumption of theduty to care for indigents was a markeddeparture from the ancient tradition offamilies and local communities bearingthe burden of social deviance and pov-erty. The shift in locus of care, however,was not accomplished simply by buildingand ﬁlling state asylums. Because ‘mad-ness’ and ‘insanity’ were invoked asjustiﬁcations for governmental interven-tions, the authorities invoking such termshad to convince the public that theseformerly vague, idiosyncratic, and cultu-rally bound constructs should now beregarded as scientiﬁc phenomena ‘whichcould only be authoritatively diagnosed,certiﬁed and dealt with by a group oflegalized experts’ (Scull, 1975: 218; citedin Boyle, 2002: 18). For a variety ofreasons, not necessarily related to scien-tiﬁc achievement, physicians became theexperts of choice and medical (psychia-tric) diagnoses became the relevant con-structs.Today, involuntary treatment is ac-complished at a very similar nexus ofclinical, scientiﬁc, and legal interests andcontroversies. Although much has chan-ged since the 18th century—especiallyregarding the language used to describebizarre behaviour—the diﬃculties sur-rounding involuntary treatment largelyremain.

989,https://openalex.org/W2067593790,2011,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology",with_mention_arab,['jor'],A late origin of the extant eukaryotic diversity: divergence time estimates using rare genomic changes,"Abstract Background Accurate estimation of the divergence time of the extant eukaryotes is a fundamentally important but extremely difficult problem owing primarily to gross violations of the molecular clock at long evolutionary distances and the lack of appropriate calibration points close to the date of interest. These difficulties are intrinsic to the dating of ancient divergence events and are reflected in the large discrepancies between estimates obtained with different approaches. Estimates of the age of Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) vary approximately twofold, from ~1,100 million years ago (Mya) to ~2,300 Mya. Results We applied the genome-wide analysis of rare genomic changes associated with conserved amino acids (RGC_CAs) and used several independent techniques to obtain date estimates for the divergence of the major lineages of eukaryotes with calibration intervals for insects, land plants and vertebrates. The results suggest an early divergence of monocot and dicot plants, approximately 340 Mya, raising the possibility of plant-insect coevolution. The divergence of bilaterian animal phyla is estimated at ~400-700 Mya, a range of dates that is consistent with cladogenesis immediately preceding the Cambrian explosion. The origin of opisthokonts (the supergroup of eukaryotes that includes metazoa and fungi) is estimated at ~700-1,000 Mya, and the age of LECA at ~1,000-1,300 Mya. We separately analyzed the red algal calibration interval which is based on single fossil. This analysis produced time estimates that were systematically older compared to the other estimates. Nevertheless, the majority of the estimates for the age of the LECA using the red algal data fell within the 1,200-1,400 Mya interval. Conclusion The inference of a ""young LECA"" is compatible with the latest of previously estimated dates and has substantial biological implications. If these estimates are valid, the approximately 1 to 1.4 billion years of evolution of eukaryotes that is open to comparative-genomic study probably was preceded by hundreds of millions years of evolution that might have included extinct diversity inaccessible to comparative approaches.
