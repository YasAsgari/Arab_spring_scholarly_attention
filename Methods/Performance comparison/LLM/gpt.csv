https://openalex.org/W1588375827,2015,Immunology and Microbiology,with_mention_arab,Detection of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium by Real-Time PCR with High Resolution Melting Analysis,"The present study describes a real-time PCR approach with high resolution melting-curve (HRM) assay developed for the detection and differentiation of Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium in fecal and urine samples collected from rural Yemen. The samples were screened by microscopy and PCR for the Schistosoma species infection. A pair of degenerate primers were designed targeting partial regions in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene of S. mansoni and S. haematobium using real-time PCR-HRM assay. The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 31.8%; 23.8% of the participants were infected with S. haematobium and 9.3% were infected with S. mansoni. With regards to the intensity of infections, 22.1% and 77.9% of S. haematobium infections were of heavy and light intensities, respectively. Likewise, 8.1%, 40.5% and 51.4% of S. mansoni infections were of heavy, moderate and light intensities, respectively. The melting points were distinctive for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, categorized by peaks of 76.49 ± 0.25 °C and 75.43 ± 0.26 °C, respectively. HRM analysis showed high detection capability through the amplification of Schistosoma DNA with as low as 0.0001 ng/µL. Significant negative correlations were reported between the real-time PCR-HRM cycle threshold (Ct) values and microscopic egg counts for both S. mansoni in stool and S. haematobium in urine (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this closed-tube HRM protocol provides a potentially powerful screening molecular tool for the detection of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. It is a simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method. Hence, this method is a good alternative approach to probe-based PCR assays.",['yem'],['yem'],['yem'],['yem'],['yem'],['yem'],True,,,,,,"Detection of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium by Real-Time PCR with High Resolution Melting Analysis The present study describes a real-time PCR approach with high resolution melting-curve (HRM) assay developed for the detection and differentiation of Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium in fecal and urine samples collected from rural Yemen.

First it highlights the importance of accounting information in the economic development of developing countries, with a particular focus on the nation of Libya. Secondly, using the case of Libya's General Company for Pipelines (GCP), it demonstrates that the use of accounting information to achieve economic development goals is determined to a large extent by the political/ideological setting in which it is generated. The study is based on a literature review and archival research, reinforced by a qualitative case study comprised of interviews, attendance at meetings and a study of internal documents. A study of The General Company for Pipelines (GCP) revealed that frequent politically driven changes in the structure and number of popular congresses and committees severely limited the use of accounting information, relegating it to a formal role. In consequence, accounting information had litle effect on stimulating economic development in Libya.
  This study focuses on one case study which does limit generalisability. However, it also suggests fruitful research areas considering the historic factors which have determined the accounting role in developing and planned economies. By providing insights about social factors which have determined the use of accounting in a planned economy, this study has implications for similar economies as they move towards a more globalised mode of operations which enhance the role of accounting in meeting economic development needs.

Therefore, we initiated the Arab Teens Lifestyle Study (ATLS). The ATLS is a multicenter collaborative project for assessing lifestyle habits of Arab adolescents. The objectives of the ATLS project were to investigate the prevalence rates for overweight and obesity, physical activity, sedentary activity and dietary habits among Arab adolescents, and to examine the interrelationships between these lifestyle variables. This paper reports on the objectives, design, methodology, and implications of the ATLS. Design/Methods: The ATLS is a school-based cross-sectional study involving 9182 randomly selected secondary-school students (14–19 years) from major Arab cities, using a multistage stratified sampling technique. The participating Arab cities included Riyadh, Jeddah, and Al-Khobar (Saudi Arabia), Bahrain, Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Kuwait, Amman (Jordan), Mosel (Iraq), Muscat (Oman), Tunisia (Tunisia) and Kenitra (Morocco).

In this paper, a review of the Yemen volcanic province and its relations with the Red Sea rifting are presented. Tertiary continental extension in Yemen resulted in the extrusion of large volumes of effusive rocks. This magmatism is divided in the Oligo-Miocene Yemen Trap Series (YTS) separated by an unconformity from the Miocene-Recent Yemen Volcanic Series (YVS). Magmas of the YTS were erupted during the synrift phase and correlate with the first stage of sea-floor spreading of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden (30 - 15 Ma), whereas the magmas of the YVS were emplaced during the post rift phase (10 - 0 Ma). A continental within plate character is recognized for both the YTS and YVS basalts. The YTS volcanic rocks are contemporaneous with, and geochemically similar to, the Ethiopian rift volcanism, just as the volcanic fields of the YVS are geochemically alike to most of the Saudi Arabian volcanics. YTS and YVS have analogous SiO2 ranges, but YVS tend to have, on average, higher alkalis and MgO contents than YTS. Fractional crystallization processes dominate geochemical variations of both series.

To first order, the different geochemical patterns agree with different degrees of partial melting of an astenospheric mantle source: 25% - 30% of partial melting for YTS and 10% - 3% for YVS.

Acceleration sensor calibration is a potential source of error. This study aims to describe and evaluate an autocalibration method to minimize calibration error using segments within the free-living records (no extra experiments needed). The autocalibration method entailed the extraction of nonmovement periods in the data, for which the measured vector magnitude should ideally be the gravitational acceleration (1 g); this property was used to derive calibration correction factors using an iterative closest-point fitting process. The reduction in calibration error was evaluated in data from four cohorts: UK (n = 921), Kuwait (n = 120), Cameroon (n = 311), and Brazil (n = 200). Our method significantly reduced calibration error in all cohorts (P < 0.01), ranging from 16.6 to 3.0 mg in the Kuwaiti cohort to 76.7 to 8.0 mg error in the Brazil cohort. Utilizing temperature sensor data resulted in a small nonsignificant additional improvement (P > 0.05). Temperature correction coefficients were highest for the z-axis, e.g., 19.6-mg offset per 5°C. Further, application of the autocalibration method had a significant impact on typical metrics used for describing human physical activity, e.g., in Brazil average wrist acceleration was 0.2 to 51% lower than uncalibrated values depending on metric selection (P < 0.01). The autocalibration method as presented helps reduce the calibration error in wearable acceleration sensor data and improves comparability of physical activity measures across study locations. Temperature ultization seems essential when temperature deviates substantially from the average temperature in the record but not for multiday summary measures.","['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']","['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']","['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']","['bra', 'cmr', 'gbr', 'kwt']","['kwt', 'bra', 'cmr', 'gbr']","['gbr', 'cmr', 'kwt', 'bra']",True,,,,,,"Autocalibration of accelerometer data for free-living physical activity assessment using local gravity and temperature: an evaluation on four continents Wearable acceleration sensors are increasingly used for the assessment of free-living physical activity.

BC incidence varies geographically, highest in Western Europe and lowest in Africa. BC in females is strongly correlated to age, the highest incidence rate amongst older women reinforcing the importance of hormonal status. BC in young females has an aggressive phenotype. There is a shared observation amongst practicing oncologists that BC in Middle East and the developing world presents at an earlier age. Aim and Objective: The aims of this study are to evaluate the age at presentation of female BC in Oman, and to compare our data with international and regional published data. It discusses the impact of young age Breast Cancer. Materials and Methods: All diagnosed female BC cases registered from 1996-2010 all over the country, were retrieved from the National Cancer Registry, Ministry of Health. BC cases were analyzed with respect to age at presentation. The data were compared with regional and international data. Results: A total of 14,109 cancer cases were recorded during the period of study. BC was the leading malignancy as 1,294 cases (9.1%). Female BC patients were 1,230; denoting 19.2% of all female cancers. 53.5% of female BC presented below 50 years of age. Male BC constituted 5% of total, with 67% of male BC occurring over 50 years of age. Compared with data from Oman, the highest rates in UK and other Western countries are above 50 years of age. These rates are four to 10 times higher than local in different age groups. Interestingly, these rates increase with increasing age in UK from 40-45 to up to 85+, keep on increasing and go up to four times higher with higher age. This phenomenon, of increasing incidence rates with age, is not observed in our local population. Discussion: BC is significantly correlated to age as reported from Western population. BC is reported at a younger age from developing and Arab World, which need to be further studied and validated. This phenomenon of BC in younger age may have significant implications and effects ranging from screening, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and cost of treatment. Conclusion: The impact on young women diagnosed with BC is enormous, ranging from psychosocial to healthcare services and economics. There is a need to study it further in depth in developing World.","['gbr', 'omn']","['gbr', 'omn']","['gbr', 'omn']","['gbr', 'omn']","['omn', 'gbr']","['omn', 'gbr']",True,,,,,,"Age at diagnosis of female breast cancer in Oman: Issues and implications Abstract Introduction: Female breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignancy diagnosed globally, about 23% of the diagnosed cancers.

Four most popular species of fish were purchased from the local market in Manama city, the capital of Bahrain. Fatty acids in raw and cooked fish were separated and quantitatively determined by gas liquid chromatography (GLC) using standard methods. The findings revealed that the predominant fatty acids in raw fish were palmitic, stearic, oleic, palmitoleic and linoleic acid (30.5-30.50, 3.6-8.8, 13.4-22.6, 6.7-14.1 and 1.3-2.0 mg/100 g respectively). With regard to cooking, curried and fried Pearlspotted Rabbitfish showed predominant changes in their fatty acid profiles. In the omega-3 and omega-6 families the dominant fatty acids were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (2.9-6.4 mg/100 g), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (1.5-14.8 mg/100 g) and arachidonic acid (AA) (2.0-5.2 mg/100 g). There was no consistent trend in the EPA/DHA ratio in all the four species of fish.

A particularly low level of cpDNA polymorphism was detected; but, in a recent study based on 14 Mediterranean trees, an intergenic (trnD-trnT) spacer was reported to be sufficiently variable to distinguish at least six haplotypes in cultivated olive. Compared to previous studies, the level of polymorphism described (nine substitutions and seven short indels on a segment of approx. 1 kbp) was particularly high. In order to enlarge upon the sample analysed, new trnD-trnT sequences were generated from 18 olive trees originating from the Mediterranean Basin, Macaronesia, S. Algeria, Kenya, Yemen, Reunion Island, Hawaii, Iran, and China. Only two base substitutions were detected in this enlarged sample, one of which discriminated between Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and other olive sub-species. Length variation at a (poly-T) microsatellite motif was also found. The relatively low variation revealed between distant populations of olive suggests that sequencing problems might be the origin of the high polymorphism previously reported in the trnD-trnT spacer. Furthermore, length polymorphism at the poly-T motif was investigated in 55 Mediterranean olive trees which had previously been analysed for other cpDNA polymorphisms. Two alleles were found in Mediterranean olive, but they did not permit detection of new cpDNA haplotypes.

The deviations (photodiode minus thermopile) are typically affected by both sun zenith angle and irradiance magnitude. For the global and direct components, most deviations (91% in the case of GHI, 87–91% in the case of DNI, depending on site) are within ±5%, and can thus be considered satisfactory. Larger deviations in direct and global irradiance are typically found under low zenith angles (summer conditions). The main source of concern is the negative bias and intricate pattern found in the diffuse deviations, most of the time. Only 46–61% of the deviations (depending on site) are within ±5%. The diffuse issue seems to be caused by an insufficient spectral correction of the diffuse reading. The so-called “cat ear” angular issue (a sudden spike in sensitivity for an angle of incidence ≈80°, combined with a sudden drop in sensitivity beyond ≈85°) is also still present in the direct and global irradiance measurements under clear conditions. The present results underline the imperfect nature of the empirical corrections typically applied to photodiode instruments to improve their irradiance estimates.

An increased number of tryptase+ cells (mast cells) was found in the stroma. VEGF+/IL-8+/RANTES+ cells were also found abundantly in the stroma of all BCC lesions. The number of VEGF+, IL-8+ and RANTES+ cells was significantly higher than that in controls. By immunohistochemistry of serial sections, tryptase+ cells were found to express VEGF, IL-8 or RANTES. Messenger RNA expression of IL-8 and RANTES was also observed in the BCC lesions. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; This study suggests that mast cells may play an active role in the angiogenesis of BCC through the production of VEGF and IL-8. Furthermore, mast cells may also regulate lymphocytic infiltration through the production of IL-8 and RANTES.",[]

https://openalex.org/W1963590211,2006,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology",field_20,Genome-Wide Identification of Human Functional DNA Using a Neutral Indel Model,"It has become clear that a large proportion of functional DNA in the human genome does not code for protein. Identification of this non-coding functional sequence using comparative approaches is proving difficult and has previously been thought to require deep sequencing of multiple vertebrates. Here we introduce a new model and comparative method that, instead of nucleotide substitutions, uses the evolutionary imprint of insertions and deletions (indels) to infer the past consequences of selection. The model predicts the distribution of indels under neutrality, and shows an excellent fit to human-mouse ancestral repeat data. Across the genome, many unusually long ungapped regions are detected that are unaccounted for by the neutral model, and which we predict to be highly enriched in functional DNA that has been subject to purifying selection with respect to indels. We use the model to determine the proportion under indel-purifying selection to be between 2.56% and 3.25% of human euchromatin. Since annotated protein-coding genes comprise only 1.2% of euchromatin, these results lend further weight to the proposition that more than half the functional complement of the human genome is non-protein-coding. The method is surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two or three mammalian genomes. Applying the method to the human, mouse, and dog genomes, we identify 90 Mb of human sequence under indel-purifying selection, at a predicted 10% false-discovery rate and 75% sensitivity.

The method's high sensitivity to functional sequence such as microRNAs suggest that as yet unannotated microRNA genes are enriched among the sequences identified. Furthermore, its independence of substitutions allowed us to identify sequence that has been subject to heterogeneous selection, that is, sequence subject to both positive selection with respect to substitutions and purifying selection with respect to indels.

Identification of this non-coding functional sequence using comparative approaches is proving difficult and has previously been thought to require deep sequencing of multiple vertebrates. Here we introduce a new model and comparative method that, instead of nucleotide substitutions, uses the evolutionary imprint of insertions and deletions (indels) to infer the past consequences of selection. The model predicts the distribution of indels under neutrality, and shows an excellent fit to human-mouse ancestral repeat data. Across the genome, many unusually long ungapped regions are detected that are unaccounted for by the neutral model, and which we predict to be highly enriched in functional DNA that has been subject to purifying selection with respect to indels. We use the model to determine the proportion under indel-purifying selection to be between 2.56% and 3.25% of human euchromatin. Since annotated protein-coding genes comprise only 1.2% of euchromatin, these results lend further weight to the proposition that more than half the functional complement of the human genome is non-protein-coding. The method is surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two or three mammalian genomes. Applying the method to the human, mouse, and dog genomes, we identify 90 Mb of human sequence under indel-purifying selection, at a predicted 10% false-discovery rate and 75% sensitivity. As expected, most of the identified sequence represents unannotated material, while the recovered proportions of known protein-coding and microRNA genes closely match the predicted sensitivity of the method. The method's high sensitivity to functional sequence such as microRNAs suggest that as yet unannotated microRNA genes are enriched among the sequences identified.

This lipase preparation exhibits increased esterification activity (155 μmol g−1 min−1), up to of three times greater than that prepared with TEOS (52 μmol g−1 min−1), and almost twice that prepared with MTMS/PDMS (89 μmol g−1 min−1) as precursors.",[]

Using large electronic databases, it is shown that the use of the term in leading Anglophone academic journals was rare up to the 1940s. Citations of the term were generally disapproving of the racist or imperialist ideologies with which it was associated.

I sketch out the transition to an evolutionary approach to homology in which all classes of similarity are interpreted against the single branching tree of life, and outline the evidence for the application of homology across all levels and features of the biological hierarchy, including behavior. Owen contrasted homology with analogy. While this is not incorrect it is a pre‐evolutionary contrast.

At 24 hours, telmisartan was more effective than benazepril (mean ± SEM ΔSBP, 15.7 ± 1.9 mm Hg vs 55.9 ± 12.42 mm Hg, respectively).Results indicated that telmisartan administration may have advantages over benazepril administration for cats with renal or cardiovascular disease.",[]

Another tool for evaluating animals' affective state is cognitive bias testing, and although it has been attempted, a link has not yet been made between cognitive bias and anticipatory behavior levels. Bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) in captivity increase the performance of behaviors such as surface‐looking and spy‐hopping in anticipation of training sessions during which food is provided. In this study we measured anticipatory behavior frequency in bottlenose dolphins prior to positive reinforcement training sessions, and assessed whether frequency of anticipatory behavior correlated with their performance on cognitive bias tasks. We found that higher frequencies of anticipatory behavior for training sessions was significantly associated with more pessimistic judgements in cognitive bias tests, supporting previous findings linking higher reward sensitivity with negative affective states.

Comparison of the seasonality of these 2 diseases can identify whether their own unique risk factors are more important than the risk factors they share. Using a database from 46 veterinarians distributed across the United Kingdom, the seasonality of treatments for these 4 diseases was evaluated. This analysis showed that the seasonality of lameness in UK dairy cattle was significantly reduced in comparison with previous reports from the 1980s. This was primarily due to 1) a reduction in the seasonality of digital dermatitis (outbreaks of which accounted for 6.7% of veterinary reports), with only 60% of reports during the winter as opposed to 72% in earlier studies, and 2) a change in the seasonality of white-line disease from a disease that was most commonly seen in the winter (55% of reports) to a disease that was most commonly reported in the late summer or early autumn, with significantly more reports in August and October than in February.

The temperament and live weight of 2229 Nellore cattle was assessed at approximately 550 days of age. Five measurements of cattle temperament were recorded: flight speed test (FS, in m/s), visual scores of movement in the crush (MOV), crush score (CS), temperament score (TS), and the qualitative behavior assessment method (QBA), by using a list of 12 behavioral based adjectives as descriptors of temperament. Average daily weight gain (ADG) was calculated for each animal. For statistical analysis of QBA data, the Principal Component Analysis was used. A temperament index (TI) was defined for each animal using the scores for the first principal component. Pearson's correlation coefficients were estimated between TI with FS and ADG. A mixed model ANOVA was used to analyze the TI variation as a function of TS, CS, and MOV.

https://openalex.org/W2126418006,2012,Environmental Science,field_20,Pneumatic oil barriers: The promise of area bubble plumes,"Reviews of bubble curtain oil herding studies in 1971 and in 1997 concluded that a bubble oil boom, or pneumatic oil barrier, is ineffective for retaining oil spills except in quiescent water, such as harbors. A bubble oil boom generates a sea-surface outwelling flow that traps or blocks oil. The primary bubble oil boom failure mode arises from oil droplet injection due to turbulence and instabilities at the oil slick front, where the outwelling flow balances the oil spreading. Bubble oil boom leakage occurs where these droplets are entrained into and pass through the bubble barrier. Increasing bubble flow creates stronger outwelling flows but increases turbulence and instabilities, leading to enhanced oil droplet entrainment.

A bubble oil boom generates a sea-surface outwelling flow that traps or blocks oil. The primary bubble oil boom failure mode arises from oil droplet injection due to turbulence and instabilities at the oil slick front, where the outwelling flow balances the oil spreading. Bubble oil boom leakage occurs where these droplets are entrained into and pass through the bubble barrier. Increasing bubble flow creates stronger outwelling flows but increases turbulence and instabilities, leading to enhanced oil droplet entrainment.

This study used an alternative method, which takes into account the maladaptation of local tree populations to a changing climate, to analyse the effect of a warming climate on the timber supply of boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests. The effect of climate change on tree growth and survival was predicted with a recent transfer-response model, which is based on a large number of provenance trials conducted in Finland and Sweden. Calculations were made for a 75-year period, assuming that the temperature sum (degree-days >5°C) will increase by 3 degree-days per year. By the end of the 75-year calculation period, the climate-induced mean annual increase in timber supply for 10 hypothetical stands was predicted to be 3.5 per cent in southern Finland (0.23 m3 ha−1 a−1), 10.6 per cent in central Finland (0.47 m3 ha−1 a−1), and 12.5 per cent in northern Finland (0.37 m3 ha−1 a−1). These increments in timber production are much lower than those obtained in previous studies.

This study used an alternative method, which takes into account the maladaptation of local tree populations to a changing climate, to analyse the effect of a warming climate on the timber supply of boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests. The effect of climate change on tree growth and survival was predicted with a recent transfer-response model, which is based on a large number of provenance trials conducted in Finland and Sweden. Calculations were made for a 75-year period, assuming that the temperature sum (degree-days >5°C) will increase by 3 degree-days per year. By the end of the 75-year calculation period, the climate-induced mean annual increase in timber supply for 10 hypothetical stands was predicted to be 3.5 per cent in southern Finland (0.23 m3 ha−1 a−1), 10.6 per cent in central Finland (0.47 m3 ha−1 a−1), and 12.5 per cent in northern Finland (0.37 m3 ha−1 a−1). These increments in timber production are much lower than those obtained in previous studies. The prediction of the climate-change-induced increment in timber supply was a 100 per cent overestimate when it was calculated using the climate–productivity relationship of the diameter increment model.","['fin', 'swe']"

In Malaysia, they occur mainly along the coastal plains of Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. Soils that have been drained are characterized by very low pH and high amounts of exchangeable aluminum (Al), both resulting from the oxidation of pyrite. This article explains the transformation of pyrite when pyrite-bearing sediments present in acid sulfate soils undergo weathering. Soil samples containing pyrite from Cg-horizons of selected acid sulfate soils in Peninsular Malaysia were incubated in the laboratory. Some samples were treated with peat, superphosphate, calcium silicate, or dolomite so as to reduce the oxidation of pyrite. Some were left unamended as a control. Changes in pyrite morphology were studied by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX). At the end of incubation period, water-soluble metals were determined. Pyrite in the unoxidized state has iron (Fe) to sulfur (S) ratio of 1:2, indicating the absence of heavy metal contamination in the pyrite structure. This suggests that when pyrite dissolves, there is little risk of pollution with respect to heavy metals. Pyrite dissolved quickly to form jarosite as its disintegration proceeded.

We explore the consequences that these changes are likely to have on population differentiation of adaptive traits. Superimposed on the spatial redistribution of the species, will there be a redistribution of their genetic variation? We base our predictions on a conceptual framework, whose elements are the extant differentiation, and the predicted divergent evolution of populations along purposely chosen altitudinal/latitudinal gradients. We consider simultaneously phenotypic and genetic divergence, but emphasize genetically driven population differentiation. We illustrate phenotypic and genetic patterns of variation with examples from well‐studied northern and southern hemisphere tree genera Quercus and Eucalyptus . Most phenotypic traits show very large in situ clinal variation with variation in altitude or latitude. Genetic clines detected in common gardens usually follow the observed in situ phenotypic clines, reflecting cogradient variation. Rare counter gradients have also been detected, where phenotypic and genetic clines exhibit opposing signs. These patterns suggest that plasticity and selection contributed in most cases synergistically to the extant differentiation. We anticipate that microevolutionary processes will be different along environmental gradients. At the leading edge, availability of newly suitable habitats will trigger migration favouring genotypes equipped with colonists attributes. At the rear edges of the distribution, populations will be submitted to strong selective pressures favouring genotypes capable of withstanding drought and heat stress. Central populations will benefit from the plastic response of trees that will temporarily compensate for the maladaptation, until genetic adaptive variation will be restored by gene flow, mutation or recombination. We make predictions about future differentiation along environmental gradients, by highlighting traits that are likely to diverge, the rate at which differentiation will take place, and the role of gene flow and hybridization. We envisage that parallel selection may maintain differentiation at extant levels, whereas divergent selection will promote substantial differentiation for traits facilitating adaptation to contrasting conditions along the environmental gradient. We anticipate that genetic divergence may occur very rapidly and will be enhanced by the multilocus architecture of most adaptive traits.",['-'],,['-'],['-'],[],[],True,[],,['-'],,,"Genetic divergence in forest trees: understanding the consequences of climate change Summary Predicted climate change is heading in many respects into untested environmental conditions for trees and to the reshuffling of species distributions.

We detected 153 haplotypes in 245 individuals. Mismatch analyses detected rapid population expansion in nine regional groups. Long‐term estimates of gene flow revealed a unidirectional manner from peripheral groups towards central plateau groups. In contrast, gene flow among central plateau groups was bidirectional. Our results indicate that the population expansion of most groups occurred 0.24–0.03 Mya, which mostly coincides with the interglacial period before the last glacial maximum. Gene flow of O. curzoniae was closely related to the different effects of the extensive glacial period (EGP) and the last glacial period (LGP) on the species. The EGP had caused extinction of all central populations, while the LGP had very limited influence on the populations that recolonized the central region. However, the glaciers in the relatively humid areas surrounding the interior of the plateau during the LGP were substantial and had prevented or greatly reduced the ‘counter’ gene flow from the central populations to the edge populations, resulting in a unidirectional gene flow.

Papers describing software published as open source are amongst the most widely cited publications (e.g., BLAST [1], [2] and Clustal-W [3]), suggesting many scientific studies may not have been possible without some kind of open software to collect observations, analyze data, or present results. It is surprising, therefore, that so few papers are accompanied by open software, given the benefits that this may bring.
 
 Publication of the source code you write not only can increase your impact [4], but also is essential if others are to be able to reproduce your results. Reproducibility is a tenet of computational science [5], and critical for pipelines employed in data-driven biological research. Publishing the source for the software you created as well as input data and results allows others to better understand your methodology, and why it produces, or fails to produce, expected results. Public release might not always be possible, perhaps due to intellectual property policies at your or your collaborators' institutes; and it is important to make sure you know the regulations that apply to you. Open licensing models can be incredibly flexible and do not always prevent commercial software release [5].
 
 Simply releasing the source under an open license, however, is not sufficient if you wish your code to remain useful beyond its publication [6]. The sustainability of software after publication is probably the biggest problem faced by researchers who develop it, and it is here that participating in open development from the outset can make the biggest impact. Grant-based funding is often exhausted shortly after new software is released, and without support, in-house maintenance of the software and the systems it depends on becomes a struggle. As a consequence, the software will cease to work or become unavailable for download fairly quickly [7], which may contravene archival policies stipulated by your journal or funding body. A collaborative and open project allows you to spread the resource and maintenance load to minimize these risks, and significantly contributes to the sustainability of your software.
 
 If you have the choice, embracing an open approach to development has tremendous benefits. It allows you to build on the work of other scientists, and enables others to build on your own efforts.

To develop and demonstrate the relevant framework, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was applied to establish the relative efficiency of plastering crews working in building projects located in different cities around Turkey. Data were collected from 40 crews of varying characteristics, and their technical efficiency scores were computed using the Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) model, which is based on variable returns-to-scale (VRS). The model yields efficiency scores that range between 0 and 1, and a company or crew is considered efficient if its score is 1.0 (100%). Efficient and inefficient crews were identified and ranked on this basis in the study. Cross tabulation analyses were subsequently conducted to gain further insights into the relationships between the efficiency scores and input factors of numbers of skilled and unskilled laborers, daily labor unit costs, work hours, average age of crew members, total crew experience, plastering location, plastering technique, and plaster type. No discernible relationship could be identified between the efficiency scores and productivity outputs of the crews. It was found that plastering technique, plastering location, and total crew experience had a significant association with crew efficiency.

The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of fecal incontinence in pts with CD perianal fistulas and to determine if there is a difference in outcomes between those pts who have undergone primarily medical or surgical treatment for their perianal disease Methods: The medical records of pts who presented to the GI Clinic at a single academic medical center between 1/01 and 1/04 with perianal CD were reviewed. Demographic data and information regarding treatment was recorded. Mailed questionnaires and telephone interviews were conducted to determine the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) score and patient satisfaction. Results: Of 77 pts identified with CD perianal fistulas, a total of 40 (52%) completed the questionnaire. 25 (63%) pts had surgical treatment while15 had medical treatment only.

A non‐invasive method to induce itch and scratching is the presentation of itch‐related (audio‐) visual stimulus material, like slide‐supported lectures on skin diseases or crawling insects. Also, watching videos showing other people scratching provokes itch and the desire to scratch. In this review, we focus on psychological factors, which were shown to be associated with itch and scratching provoked by (audio‐) visual itch stimuli. First, we summarize the findings on the relationship between personality characteristics and (audio‐) visually induced itch. Agreeableness and self‐consciousness were shown to be associated with induced itch and scratching in patients with chronic skin diseases, while neuroticism was linked to induced itch in healthy subjects. Second, we present results of a recent study, in which we altered the expectations towards audio‐visually induced itch and scratching by changing the information given on upcoming itch stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W1993773943,2007,Medicine,field_20,The Inhibitory Effect of Minocycline on Hypertrophic Scarring,"Background: Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that serve to degrade the extracellular matrix, giving them a central role in the inflammatory and wound-healing processes; they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertrophic scarring. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of minocycline, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, on hypertrophic scarring. Methods: Standardized wounds were created on the ears of eight New Zealand White rabbits. Half of the rabbits received daily injections of minocycline, whereas the other half received daily injections of saline (control). After 4 weeks, the resulting ear scars were harvested. Histologic slides were prepared from the thickest cross-sections of the scars, and from these slides the cross-sectional area of each scar was measured. A hypertrophic index was calculated by comparing the area of the scar to the baseline value of unwounded skin. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS/STAT NESTED Procedure for hierarchical data.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of minocycline, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, on hypertrophic scarring. Methods: Standardized wounds were created on the ears of eight New Zealand White rabbits. Half of the rabbits received daily injections of minocycline, whereas the other half received daily injections of saline (control). After 4 weeks, the resulting ear scars were harvested. Histologic slides were prepared from the thickest cross-sections of the scars, and from these slides the cross-sectional area of each scar was measured. A hypertrophic index was calculated by comparing the area of the scar to the baseline value of unwounded skin. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS/STAT NESTED Procedure for hierarchical data. Results: Among the rabbits treated with minocycline, the mean hypertrophic index was 1.08 ± 0.01, compared with 1.54 ± 0.03 in the control group (p = 0.03), representing an 85 percent reduction in hypertrophic area.

We investigated whether nutrition education sessions at the work place added to internet-based wellness information and exercise resources would facilitate weight and fat mass loss in a racially diverse population of overweight female employees. Methods: A total of 199 (average body mass index 33.9±6.3 kg m −2 ) nondiabetic women (57% black) at our institution were randomized to a 6-month program of either internet-based wellness information (WI) combined with dietitian-led nutrition education group sessions (GS) weekly for 3 months and then monthly with shift in emphasis to weight loss maintenance ( n =99) or to WI alone ( n =100).

Although the role of ET(A)R in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction has been studied, little is known about ET(B)R. ET(B)R is a G-protein coupled receptor with a molecular mass of ~50 kDa and 442 amino acids arranged in seven transmembrane domains. Alternative splice variants of ET(B)R and heterodimerization and cross-talk with ET(A)R may affect the receptor function. ET(B)R has been identified in numerous blood vessels with substantial effects in the systemic, renal, pulmonary, coronary and cerebral circulation.

The seasonal and sub-seasonal dynamics of iron availability within the sub-Antarctic zone (SAZ; ∼40–45∘ S) play an important role in the distribution, biomass and productivity of the phytoplankton community.

Biological observations utilizing grow-out iron addition incubation experiments were performed at different stages of the seasonal cycle within the SAZ to determine whether iron availability at the time of sampling was sufficient to meet biological demands at different times of the growing season.

The landscape reconstruction attests to the existence of a loessic rolling plain drained by a subordinate fluvial system, composed of both unconfined and confined flows, with locally ponded areas. Over these, thick stacked cumulative paleo-Ultisols and vertic paleo-Ultisols developed with scarce simple and stacked compound vitric Entisols analogues and compound Inceptisols equivalents.

The paper includes a survey of the history of the low levels of mortality seen currently. The survey includes some discussion on the potential for future improvements and considers topical issues, such as the potential impact of obesity on life expectancy projections (and, in turn, the minimum value applied to improvements). The financial impact of subjecting projections of mortality improvement to a minimum value is quantified.",['gbr']

The new strong interaction site between the sulfonic acid group of SFIL and an H2SO4 molecule through a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction was observed, which was beneficial to the catalytic activity and stability of the sulfuric acid.

https://openalex.org/W2133478656,2003,Mathematics,field_20,On weighting the rates in non‐response weights,"A basic estimation strategy in sample surveys is to weight units inversely proportional to the probability of selection and response. Response weights in this method are usually estimated by the inverse of the sample-weighted response rate in an adjustment cell, that is, the ratio of the sum of the sampling weights of respondents in a cell to the sum of the sampling weights for respondents and non-respondents in that cell. We show by simulations that weighting the response rates by the sampling weights to adjust for design variables is either incorrect or unnecessary. It is incorrect, in the sense of yielding biased estimates of population quantities, if the design variables are related to survey non-response; it is unnecessary if the design variables are unrelated to survey non-response. The correct approach is to model non-response as a function of the adjustment cell and design variables, and to estimate the response weight as the inverse of the estimated response probability from this model. This approach can be implemented by creating adjustment cells that include design variables in the cross-classification, if the number of cells created in this way is not too large.

The scheme is specifically formulated to maintain global second order temporal accuracy using implicit solvers for each discipline, and requires no subiterations between solvers. This is achieved by using second-order time integrators for each solver combined with second-order extrapolations of the pressure and heat flux to predict the thermo-structural loadings at the proper time step. Furthermore, the scheme is designed to exploit disparities in time scales between the solvers through the use of fluid and structural subcycling, in which multiple fluid steps are taken between each structural step, and multiple structural steps between each thermal step. Here, second order global accuracy is maintained using second order interpolations of the displacement, velocity, and temperature over the structural time step, and temperature over the thermal time step. The accuracy of the scheme is evaluated on a simple panel in high supersonic flow, and is found to yield second-order accurate solutions both with and without subcycling. The impact of neglecting the extrapolation and interpolation mechanisms on accuracy is also investigated. In general disabling any of these mechanisms degrades the global accuracy to first order.

In conjunction with BMI, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting glucose, and serum lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) were measured. LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula. Using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound scan, we measured intimal medial thickness (IMT) in plaque-free segments of bilateral common carotid arteries, and the mean of IMT in 2 vessels was used for the analysis. Furthermore, we calculated the degree of stenosis in plaque segments of bilateral common carotid arteries. The degree of carotid atherosclerosis was expressed as a percentage ratio between the area of plaque and that of the lumen using the formula (Lumen Area Residual - Lumen Area)/Lumem Area x 100. Both the areas were automatically measured by the system on a frozen transverse scanning plane at the site of maximal narrowing.

Pain and anxiety triggered by dental treatment can induce the secretion of endogenous catecholamines. When the situation is combined with the use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors, it may increase its undesirable effects on the cardiovascular system and respiratory systems. Aim of the work To evaluate the effects of dental procedures with and without local anesthesia on pulmonary function and arterial oxygen saturation in healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Patients and methods Our study included 30 asthmatic patients, and 20 healthy volunteers. Careful history taking, clinical examination, spirometry and pulse oximetry to measure O 2 saturation before and 10 min after dental procedures were obtained. Results Pulmonary function showed a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation in asthmatic patients and a statistically significant decrease in O 2 saturation in the healthy group after dental procedures compared to pre-procedure results. Asthmatic patients receiving local anesthesia had a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation after dental procedures compared to pre-procedure results.

Abstract Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways. Pain and anxiety triggered by dental treatment can induce the secretion of endogenous catecholamines. When the situation is combined with the use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors, it may increase its undesirable effects on the cardiovascular system and respiratory systems. Aim of the work To evaluate the effects of dental procedures with and without local anesthesia on pulmonary function and arterial oxygen saturation in healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Patients and methods Our study included 30 asthmatic patients, and 20 healthy volunteers. Careful history taking, clinical examination, spirometry and pulse oximetry to measure O 2 saturation before and 10 min after dental procedures were obtained. Results Pulmonary function showed a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation in asthmatic patients and a statistically significant decrease in O 2 saturation in the healthy group after dental procedures compared to pre-procedure results. Asthmatic patients receiving local anesthesia had a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation after dental procedures compared to pre-procedure results. In the healthy group, there was a statistically significant decrease in O 2 saturation after dental filling and dental prosthesis and in asthmatic patients after dental filling, extraction, prosthesis, and scaling compared to that before. Conclusion Asthmatic patients may be at a higher risk of developing oxygen desaturation after dental procedures regardless of their type with and without local anesthesia and a decrease in PEF after dental procedures with local anesthesia.",[]

Materials and methods After fasting for 12 hours, 16 adult volunteers (&gt; 65 kg) ingested two types of meal: Breakfast (n = 8) and Lunch (n = 8). Accidental ingestion of fluoride gel used in molding trays was simulated (12,300 ppm; 61.5 mg F; pH = 4.65) 15 minutes after eating. After ingestion of the fluoride solution, 3 mL of venous blood were collected at the following times: Zero (before ingestion) and 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 2, and 3 hours. Fluoride concentrations in blood plasma were determined using an ion selective electrode. Results With the exception of time 0 (p &gt; 0.05), the average blood plasma concentration of the breakfast group (BG) (0.34 ± 0.04 mg/L) was higher than that of the lunch group (LG) (0.24 ± 0.03 mg/L), with the moment of peak concentration being 2 hours after ingestion for both groups (BG = 0.4 mg/L; LG = 0.28 mg/L). Conclusion Results reinforce the idea that eating before undergoing professional application of fluoride is a factor of extreme importance regarding its safety, and that the time following a patient's heaviest meal should be the time of choice for planning clinical care.

Following liquid–liquid extraction, the analyte was separated using an isocratic mobile phase on a reverse-phase column and analyzed by MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using the respective [M + H]+ ions, m/z 388 to 205 for urapidil and m/z 452 to 344 for the internal standard. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 0.1–500 ng/mL for urapidil in plasma. Acceptable precision (<7%) and accuracy (100 ± 8%) were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range. The method was successfully applied to quantify urapidil concentrations in a preclinical pharmacokinetic study after a single oral administration of urapidil at 3 mg/kg to rats. Following oral administration the maximum mean concentration in plasma (Cmax; 616 ± 73 ng/mL) was achieved at 0.5 h (Tmax) and area under curve (AUC0–24) was 1841 ± 308 ng h/mL.

Following liquid–liquid extraction, the analyte was separated using an isocratic mobile phase on a reverse-phase column and analyzed by MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using the respective [M + H]+ ions, m/z 388 to 205 for urapidil and m/z 452 to 344 for the internal standard. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 0.1–500 ng/mL for urapidil in plasma. Acceptable precision (<7%) and accuracy (100 ± 8%) were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range. The method was successfully applied to quantify urapidil concentrations in a preclinical pharmacokinetic study after a single oral administration of urapidil at 3 mg/kg to rats. Following oral administration the maximum mean concentration in plasma (Cmax; 616 ± 73 ng/mL) was achieved at 0.5 h (Tmax) and area under curve (AUC0–24) was 1841 ± 308 ng h/mL.

Their lifetime can sometimes reach several hours and be much longer than the residence times available for gas/liquid separation. However, the conditions of formation and stability of such foams have been poorly studied in the literature, in contrast to the foamability of aqueous systems. On the fields, it is currently observed that crude oils enriched with asphaltenes form particularly stable foams. In this work, we have studied the influence of asphaltenes on the foamability of oil mixtures. All the experiments were performed on model systems of crude oils, that-is-to-say decane/toluene mixtures containing asphaltenes at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 wt%. We in particular demonstrate that, within the investigated concentration range, asphaltenes from two different wells do not have any significant surface active properties despite their contribution to the foamability of oil mixtures. We show that the formation of an asphaltene layer at the interface with air that has been evidenced in the past results from solvent evaporation. Using a recently developed experiment based on the Marangoni effect with our model oils, we demonstrate that asphaltenes are not surface active in those oils. We further characterize the oil foamability by measuring the lifetime of the foam formed by blowing nitrogen through the liquid in a column. At concentrations larger than 1 wt%, asphaltenes significantly enhance the foamability of the oil mixtures. Moreover, the closer the asphaltenes are to their limit of precipitation the larger the foamability. However, we evidence that the oil mixtures themselves foam and we show the importance to consider that effect on the foamability. In addition, we observe that the foamability of the asphaltenes solutions unexpectedly varies with the initial height of the liquid in the column.

A Late Palaeocene Laurasian origin for the lineage with later dispersal events, or an older Indo-Malagasian lineage with an early vicariance and later dispersion events, remain two possible explanations of the origin of the Augilini.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A5307860-2947-4EBA-BD12-E71E78CC535E","['dom', 'mdg']"

This index is based on a limited number of factors, the most important one being topography. Sediment connectivity indices values probably depend on the digital elevation model (DEM) resolution. The aim of this study was, first, to compare the effect of DEM pixel size (between 0.25 and 10 m, using an UAV) in the Belgian loess belt, a lowland area. We show that the index values were lower when the pixel size decreased (a difference of about 20% in value between 0.25 and 10 m). In addition, the impact of linear features in the watershed (e.g. grass strip, bank and road) was lower with the largest pixel sizes, and the connectivity pattern was affected with a pixel size of 5 m or more. At lower pixel sizes (1 m or below), some more disconnected regions appeared. These corresponded with zones where there had been water stagnation during and after rainfalls, and was corroborated by field observations. This confirmed the need for a proper resolution according to the objectives of the study. The second aim of this study was to deduce a minimum pixel size for connectivity study, helping local erosion or sedimentation location and consequent land management decisions. In our context, 1 m stands as the optimum DEM resolution. This pixel size permitted location of all ‘key areas’ in terms of erosion.

The current insecticides have caused resistance in insects and have caused outbreaks of thrips.

Several species of minute pirate bugs of the genus Orius play a significant role in the biological control of a large number of thrips species, such as F. occidentalis. In this study, the insecticidal activity of four ethanolic plant extracts (Cercis siliquastrum L., Calendula officinalis L., Peganum harmala L., Melia azedarach L.) in integration with Orius horvathi (Reuter) were evaluated for controlling F. occidentalis. The present research aimed to find plant extracts with a good impact on F. occidentalis but which have fewer side effects on O. horvathi. The results showed that P. harmala extract can be considered compatible with the natural enemy for controlling thrips.

In-depth interviews were conducted to 18 consumers(10 singles, 8 married) in the age range of 2049 and having purchased luxury products twice in last 1 year. The interviews were directed by a trained mediator according to the interview guidelines and recorded. Interviewees were asked to talk freely and protocols were made for data analysis. Similarities were found regarding the salient attributes, brand awareness of luxury products as known in general; however, the perceived importance of each attribute of luxury products seemed to be changed as mcLuxury has continued. Moreover, the consumers' attitudes toward the luxury products consumption tended to become favorable than before, and the motives to buy luxury products were more value- oriented and self fulfillment rather than display one's wealth.

In-depth interviews were conducted to 18 consumers(10 singles, 8 married) in the age range of 2049 and having purchased luxury products twice in last 1 year. The interviews were directed by a trained mediator according to the interview guidelines and recorded. Interviewees were asked to talk freely and protocols were made for data analysis. Similarities were found regarding the salient attributes, brand awareness of luxury products as known in general; however, the perceived importance of each attribute of luxury products seemed to be changed as mcLuxury has continued. Moreover, the consumers' attitudes toward the luxury products consumption tended to become favorable than before, and the motives to buy luxury products were more value- oriented and self fulfillment rather than display one's wealth.

One tactic is to establish consolidation hubs that collect shipments from several suppliers, consolidate these shipments, and direct the consolidated shipments to the appropriate manufacturing plant. We consider the network design problem to implement this tactic, namely deciding the number, location and operation of consolidation hubs so as to minimize the total logistics costs for the network. To solve this network design problem, we define candidate shipping options for each potential hub, for which we can pre-compute the shipping quantities required from each supplier, and the incurred shipping costs and inventory holding costs.

Cisplatin (DDP) triggers the rapid degradation of CTR1 and thus limits its own accumulation. We sought to determine the effect of DDP and copper on the expression of CTR2. Changes in CTR1 and CTR2 mRNA and protein levels in human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells and ATOX1(+/+) and ATOX1(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts in response to exposure to DDP and copper were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and deconvolution microscopy. DDP triggered rapid degradation of CTR1 in 2008 human ovarian cancer cells. However, it increased the expression of CTR2 mRNA and protein levels. Expression of CTR2 was heavily modulated by changes in intracellular copper concentration; copper depletion produced rapid disappearance of CTR2, whereas excess copper increased the level of CTR2 protein. This increase was associated with an increase in CTR2 mRNA and prolongation of the CTR2 half-life. Consistent with prior observations that short hairpin RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CTR2 enhanced DDP uptake and tumor cell kill, reduction of CTR2 by copper starvation also enhanced DDP uptake and cytotoxicity. Comparison of the ability of copper and DDP to modulate the expression of CTR1 in ATOX1(+/+) and ATOX1(-/-) indicated that ATOX1 participates in the regulation of CTR2 expression.

For 10 weeks, the fish were fed one of five experimental diets; a basal diet containing 2.31 mg/kg of inherent Se or diets supplemented with SeMet to provide 4.91, 9.58, 15.43 or 20.87 mg/kg of Se. The results showed that the fish muscle proximate composition, feed conversion ratio and survival were not sensitive to dietary Se treatments; and no histopathological lesions were observed in heart and intestine tissues of the fish. The Se concentrations in liver and muscle tissues showed a strong linear positive relationship with the levels of Se in diets. Fish when fed the basal diet exhibited Se deficiency symptoms including myopathy, reduced feed intake, glutathione peroxidase activity and growth; whereas those fed the diets containing ≥ 4.91 mg Se/kg did not. While fish fed the 15.43 mg Se/kg diet did not show any toxic effects, the 20.87 mg Se/kg diet caused histopathological changes in liver and spleen as well as reduced feed intake, growth, haematocrit and hepatosomatic index, indicating Se toxicity. In conclusion, Se levels in liver and muscle tissues can be used as effective indicators of dietary Se exposure and dietary Se level between 15.43 and 20.87 mg/kg may be a threshold level in juvenile yellowtail kingfish.",['-'],['-'],['-'],['-'],[],[],True,[],,,,,"Toxic effects of excessive levels of dietary selenium in juvenile yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) Selenomethionine (SeMet) was supplemented to a fishmeal-based diet to investigate the toxic effects of excessive levels of dietary selenium (Se) in juvenile yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi).

A growing body of research proves that organic forms of Se, mainly selenomethionine (SeMet), in poultry diets have a range of important advantages over traditional sodium selenite.

As chickens are not able to synthesize SeMet, its provision through diet is a key strategy to fight commercially relevant stresses.

Orally administered probiotic bacteria produce only temporary colonization of the intestine in patients with a fully developed gut microflora. The gastrointestinal tract of a healthy fetus is sterile. During the birth process and rapidly thereafter, microbes from the mother and the surrounding environment colonize the gastrointestinal tract until a dense, complex microflora develops. Probiotic bacteria have been shown to beneficially influence the intestinal and systemic immune system and mediate protection against nosocomial infections affecting the neonate. Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine whether oral administration of the probiotic micro‐organism Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG ( L. GG) to the pregnant woman leads to colonization of the newborn infant. Methods The authors identified six women who were taking L. GG during late pregnancy. None of the children received L. GG after birth, and their mothers discontinued its consumption at the time of delivery. L. GG concentration in fecal samples was determined by colony morphology and molecular analysis. Results In all four children delivered vaginally and in one of two children delivered by cesarean section, L. GG was present in fecal samples at 1 and 6 months of age. Three children remained colonized for at least 12 months, and in two children L. GG was detected in fecal samples at 24 months of age. Three mothers were tested 1 month post partum and no L. GG was present in fecal samples. No L. GG was found in one of these women 24 months post partum. There was no L.

To date, the available therapeutic strategies have mainly focused on removal or sequestering of excessive ROS rather than preventing their generation. In the present study we hypothesize that the selective ligation of copper and iron ions in their inactive redox states with appropriate ligands can be a novel approach for prevention of free radical generation. To testify this hypothesis the present study was devised to explore the structural, conformational and electronic requirements of a potential biocompatible inhibitor of copper induced oxidative damage to proteins. A series of chemical compounds such as neocuproine, bathophenanthroline, thiourea, acetonitrile, bathocuproine, dimethylsulfoxide, mannitol, urea and histidine were tested for their impact on copper induced oxidative damage to proteins. To measure the oxidative damage, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as the model substrate to quantitate the conversion of its free amino groups to the carbonyl counterparts under the ROS induced oxidative stress. The observed complexation behavior of Cu with the investigated ligands revealed that a ligand with soft donor sites, donor sites placed at the corners of a tetrahedron or a good π-back acceptance character shall exhibit excellent potential to inhibit copper induced oxidative damage to proteins. To validate these facts we tested two bioactive molecules viz. 1,2-(diimino-4′-antipyrinyl)-1,2-diphenyl ethane (DIDE) and rhodanine whose distinctive molecular structure meets the hypothesized prerequisites, for their protective impact against Cu induced free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Expectedly both DIDE and rhodanine were found to offer excellent protection against copper-catalyzed oxidative damage to BSA. Furthermore, based on the thermodynamic, kinetic and computational investigations, we propose that the observed antioxidant activity of DIDE and rhodanine is due to the selective stabilization of Cu(I) by these bioactive and biofriendly molecules.

The longitudinal and seasonal variations of the superrotation are more influenced by changes in the F region conductance that is modified by vertical E × B ion drift motions and neutral wind-induced ion drift motions along magnetic field lines.",['twn']

Both these flight behaviors can be recapitulated in a tethered fly, which permits the odor stimulus to be precisely controlled. In this study, we investigated the relationship between these behaviors and odor-evoked activity in primary sensory neurons. First, we verified that these behaviors are abolished by mutations that silence olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). We also found that antennal mechanosensors in Johnston's organ are required to guide upwind turns. Flight responses to an odor depend on the identity of the ORNs that are active, meaning that these behaviors involve odor discrimination and not just odor detection. Flight modulation can begin rapidly (within about 85 ms) after the onset of olfactory transduction. Moreover, just a handful of spikes in a single ORN type is sufficient to trigger these behaviors. Finally, we found that the upwind turn is triggered independently from the increase in wingbeat frequency, implying that ORN signals diverge to activate two independent and parallel motor commands.

The closed-loop system has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while the performance of the proposed control scheme is experimentally verified using a small under-actuated underwater vehicle in a test tank.",[]

Additional experimentation will yield safe and cost-effective natural powders with which adequate fingerprint development can be performed.",[]

The precision with which the prototype helps a client assess his requirements depends on (a) the type of prototype provided by the vendor and (b) the client's feedback effort. The vendor can provide either a neutral or nonneutral prototype: The nonneutral prototype influences the client towards one particular set of requirements that may not be the true requirement, and the neutral prototype allows the client to assess his true requirements.

Process variation causes core-to-core (C2C) performance asymmetry across a chip, which should be taken into consideration for application scheduling. In this paper, two types of variations beyond C2C are introduced, i.e., inter-pair and intra-pair variation in TLR-CMP. Intra-pair performance asymmetry can affect the performance of applications differently.

Plainly, when we are talking about research going wrong, we're talking about something very important. We have seen that experiments can go wrong in several ways.

It typically evolves from the early patch and plaque stage to the cutaneous nodular or tumour stage and sometimes visceral involvement is seen in the later stage. MF is also present in an erythrodermic variant accompanied by lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood involvement, known as Sezary syndrome (1). A number of different treatment modalities of MF are known. According to recently published guidelines (2, 3) they include skin-directed therapies, such as topical steroids, topical chemotherapy (nitrogen mustard and carmustine), narrow-band UVB, UVA-1 and radiotherapy, but also systemic therapy such as PUVA, methotrexate, retinoids, α-interferon, (either alone or combined with PUVA), systemic single and multi-agent chemotherapy, photopheresis, and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. anti-CD4). Doxorubicin is an antracycline, unencapsulated agent, which causes anti-neoplastic activity in a wide range of malignant diseases, especially haematologically cancers. Doxorubicin is a topoisomerase inhibitor and thereby inhibits DNA transcription and eventually causes cell death predominantly in cancer cells, as they have a higher concentration of topoisomerase enzyme than normal cells. It has a low therapeutic index and haematological toxicity is a common and dose-dependent side-effect. Antracyclineinduced cardiomyopathy can be irreversible and lead to congestive heart failure. The frequency of this side-effect is related to the cumulative doses of doxorubicin, which should not exceed 450–550 mg/m2 (4). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (LD) has a significantly different pharmacokinetic profile from the unencapsulated agents, and is associated with prolonged half-life, altered toxicity profile, and the possibility of enhanced anti-tumour activity (5).

https://openalex.org/W2022144171,2011,Health Professions,with_mention,A review of adverse event reporting in Irish surgical specialties,"Introduction Reporting of adverse events in medicine is an important concept. It is widely accepted that a key element of any healthcare service is the approach that is adopted towards reporting adverse events. Government legislation and the increased number of patient safety initiatives with widespread discussion within the medical literature marks adverse event reporting as an important topic for analysis. Methods The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) provides risk advisory services to state authorities in Ireland. This study will focus on 42,094 adverse events reported across all surgical specialties to the CIS via a confidential weblink (STARSWeb) since 2004. The most common features of each adverse event and closed medicolegal claims processed by the CIS were reviewed as part of this study. Results The majority of reported adverse events occur in orthopaedic and general surgery (73% of all cases). Slips/trips/falls are the most common adverse event reported. Doctors report only 4% of the total number of adverse events. The month of October records the highest number of adverse events with the highest frequency of adverse events taking place before 13:00 each day. The most common incident type which resulted in a claim being closed by the CIS was the perioperative/periprocedure incident (50% of all cases). Conclusions The CIS report a significant number of adverse events across a range of surgical specialties.

It is widely accepted that a key element of any healthcare service is the approach that is adopted towards reporting adverse events. Government legislation and the increased number of patient safety initiatives with widespread discussion within the medical literature marks adverse event reporting as an important topic for analysis. Methods The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) provides risk advisory services to state authorities in Ireland. This study will focus on 42,094 adverse events reported across all surgical specialties to the CIS via a confidential weblink (STARSWeb) since 2004. The most common features of each adverse event and closed medicolegal claims processed by the CIS were reviewed as part of this study. Results The majority of reported adverse events occur in orthopaedic and general surgery (73% of all cases). Slips/trips/falls are the most common adverse event reported. Doctors report only 4% of the total number of adverse events. The month of October records the highest number of adverse events with the highest frequency of adverse events taking place before 13:00 each day. The most common incident type which resulted in a claim being closed by the CIS was the perioperative/periprocedure incident (50% of all cases). Conclusions The CIS report a significant number of adverse events across a range of surgical specialties. A pattern of adverse events being reported during ‘daylight’ hours gives a clear indication that routine surgical operations and procedures carry with them a risk for injury to the patient. Particular months of the year and time of the day are more likely to be associated with reported adverse events.

A nationally representative sample with provincial representation was selected using 1996 Census information.Of the 3120 children who were originally sampled data were obtained from 2894, a response rate of 93%.The sociodemographic status of each household was assessed by a questionnaire. Dietary intake was assessed by means of a 24-hour recall and a food-frequency questionnaire from the caregivers of the children. Food purchasing practices were determined by means of a food procurement questionnaire. Hunger was assessed by a modified hunger scale questionnaire. Nutritional status was determined by means of anthropometric measurements: height, weight, head circumference and arm circumference.At the national level, stunting (height-for-age below minus two standard deviations (< -2SD) from the reference median) was by far the most common nutritional disorder, affecting nearly one in five children.

The complex is part of the Nagssugtoqidian Mobile Belt emplaced at mid- to lower-crustal level and represents an eastward continuation of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen of western Greenland. We present new whole-rock geochemical and isotopic data (whole-rock Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb, Lu-Hf and zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf, O) acquired from the Ammassalik Intrusive Complex, with the aim of reassessing its petrogenesis and evolution. The intrusive rocks and surrounding host-rocks show typical calc-alkaline signatures as well as negative Ta, Nb and Ti anomalies. The new U-Pb age data indicate a protracted magmatic history over ca. 40 Ma, involving at least three successive magmatic pulses between ca. 1910 and 1870 Ma emplaced into a granulite facies biotite-garnet paragneiss with ca. ≤ 1990 Ma protolith ages. Whole-rock trace element and isotope geochemistry indicate that the magmas that formed the Ammassalik Intrusive Complex were derived from a mildly enriched (εNd0 = −0.8 to –3.8; εSr0 = +24 to +42) and deep, garnet-bearing (MREE/HREE fractionated patterns) mantle source, possibly the sub-continental lithospheric mantle. However, the observed decreasing zircon εHf values with time (εHf0 = +2.8 to −12.5) indicate increasing degrees of crustal contamination involving variably 18O-enriched crustal material (δ18O = 7–9‰) into the mafic magmas of the complex. This interpretation suggests that the mantle-derived magma do not have a deep, garnet-bearing source, but that the continental arc signature in the Ammassalik Intrusive Complex igneous rocks may have been inherited from the assimilation of partial melts of the garnet-bearing host-rocks. In addition, based on the new crystallisation ages broadly coeval with the Columbia supercontinent build up, marked by the formation of world-class Ni-Cu deposits globally, it is proposed that the Ammassalik Intrusive Complex and the south-east Greenland region were in direct continuity of the mineralised Kotalahti belt (Svecofennian Province, Finland).

https://openalex.org/W2177803048,2015,Social Sciences,with_mention,Former Military Networks a Threat to Peace? The Demobilisation and Remobilization of Renamo in Central Mozambique,"Renamo’s recent upsurge against the Mozambican Frelimo-led government after 22 years of relative stability has challenged the country’s often celebrated disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process (1992 to 1994). Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Maringue (Sofala province), the location of the rebels’ wartime headquarters and a post-war Renamo stronghold, this paper shows that while the DDR program supposedly ended Renamo’s command and control structure, the former rebel network continued to be a central feature of ex-combatants’ social worlds. Former Renamo combatants spend most of their time in the company of their ‘colleagues of the trenches’ and engaged in relationships of dependency with political Renamo leaders and former commanders.

The Demobilisation and Remobilization of Renamo in Central Mozambique Renamo’s recent upsurge against the Mozambican Frelimo-led government after 22 years of relative stability has challenged the country’s often celebrated disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process (1992 to 1994). Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Maringue (Sofala province), the location of the rebels’ wartime headquarters and a post-war Renamo stronghold, this paper shows that while the DDR program supposedly ended Renamo’s command and control structure, the former rebel network continued to be a central feature of ex-combatants’ social worlds. Former Renamo combatants spend most of their time in the company of their ‘colleagues of the trenches’ and engaged in relationships of dependency with political Renamo leaders and former commanders. These relationships were not only shaped by the former military structure, but also by friendship, marriage, and patronage dynamics, providing ex-Renamo combatants with physical and economic safety, a sense of belonging and economic possibilities.Recent events in Mozambique suggest that the post-conflict continuation of informal wartime networks is a threat to peace and a failure of demobilization.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Dunedin, New Zealand, a city with marked income differences, and were undertaken shortly after a further tobacco excise tax increase. The interview guide explored participants’ smoking practices, their perceptions of excise tax as a strategy to reduce smoking prevalence, and the strategies they used to manage their tobacco needs. We identified three key themes: depriving the poor; tobacco as a precious commodity, and desperation. While many participants described smoking as a pleasure or coping mechanism, they also saw it as a burden that they struggled to manage. Despite trying to quit, most had failed to become smokefree and felt victimised by a punitive policy system that coerced change without supporting it.

Background: Drugs applied intratympanically in humans are thought to enter the cochlea primarily through the round window membrane (RWM). Local drug treatments of the ear are commonly evaluated in rodent models. The otic capsule is much thinner at the cochlear apex in rodents than in humans. We therefore investigated whether drugs applied to the middle ear could enter perilymph through the otic capsule as well as through the RWM. Methods: The distribution of gentamicin and the marker trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA) along the guinea pig cochlea was assessed with sequential apical perilymph sampling after 2 delivery paradigms that included 1) completely filling the tympanic bulla with solution and 2) applying the solution to the RWM only.

We evaluated the effectiveness of group discussions and commitment in improving the cleaning behaviour of shared sanitation users in three urban slums in Kampala, Uganda. The study follows the risk, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) model of behaviour change and some factors of the social dilemma theory.A pre-versus post-intervention survey was conducted in three slums of Kampala, Uganda, between December 2012 and September 2013.

Here we use a three-dimensional higher-order ice-flow model, adaptive mesh refinement and inverse methods to accurately reproduce the present-day ice flow of the Greenland ice sheet. We investigate the effect of the ice thermal regime on (1) basal sliding inversion and (2) projections over the next 100 years. We show that steady-state temperatures based on present-day conditions allow a reasonable representation of the thermal regime and that both basal conditions and century-scale projections are weakly sensitive to small changes in the initial temperature field, compared with changes in atmospheric conditions or basal sliding. We conclude that although more englacial temperature measurements should be acquired to validate the models, and a better estimation of geothermal heat flux is needed, it is reasonable to use steady-state temperature profiles for short-term projections, as external forcings remain the main drivers of the changes occurring in Greenland.",['-'],['grl'],['grl'],['-'],[],['grl'],False,['grl'],,,,,"Dependence of century-scale projections of the Greenland ice sheet on its thermal regime Abstract Observations show that the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at an increasing rate over the past few decades, which makes it a major contributor to sea-level rise.

Conclusion: No significant increased risk of spontaneous abortion among permanent night shift nurses compared to day-time nurses was found in this study, and no association was found between spontaneous abortions and the number of worked night shifts.",['nor']

Two specific issues viz., (i) comparative assessment of efficacy of antioxidants on freshly prepared terminalia biodiesel and petrodiesel blends and (ii) effect of antioxidants on long term storage behavior of T. belerica biodiesel and petrodiesel blends are considered in this study. The comparative efficacy of six antioxidant additives, viz., Vitamin E (α-tocopherol), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), Pyrogallol (PY), Propyl gallate (PG), tert-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and tert-butylhydroxyquinone (TBHQ) at varying concentration levels (100 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm and 1500 ppm) on freshly prepared terminalia biodiesel is investigated.

Here, we studied the effect of N fertilisation to oilseed rape, catch crops after oilseed rape and peas and dired drilling of winter wheat after oilseed rape on N leaching in south-west Sweden. Nitrate leaching was determined in two field experiments, dated 2004–2006 and 2005–2007, respectively, on a sandy loam. Our results show that under oilseed rape nitrate leaching was low, at 16–23 kg N ha−1, in a mild winter with drainage from October to March. In the subsequent mild winter nitrate leaching under wheat was higher, amounting to 35–94 kg N ha−1. Nitrate leaching levels were similar, 32–58 kg N ha−1, for all crops in a cold winter with a long-lasting snow cover and main drainage occurring after snowmelt in March and April. Application of fertiliser N to oilseed rape at the optimum N rate, rather than 50 kg N ha−1 above optimum, reduced leaching in a following winter wheat crop by 25 and 27 kg N ha−1 in a cold and a mild winter, respectively.

An undersown catch crop of peas, then grown until November, reduced leaching by 15 kg N ha−1. Direct drilling of winter wheat after oilseed rape had no effect. These findings show that there are risks of enhanced leaching in early spring after a cold winter with a snow cover and superficially frozen soil.

The prevalence has been found to be up to 20% in five year old children, and it is considered the most common urological childhood complication. Material and Methods This study was conducted on Makassed School children aged 5–18 years. This was a two-step study, the first step was a questionnaire distributed to the children to be answered by their parents. The second step included individually meeting with every child who met the inclusion criteria and his/her parents and physically examining the child. Results 11,440 questionnaires were distributed to school children aged 5–18 years, to be answered by their parents. Of the 7270 parents who responded back, 6620 reported no enuresis, 90 (1.25%) reported only diurnal enuresis, 107 (1.5%) reported diurnal and nocturnal enuresis, and 453 parents reported their child having nocturnal enuresis only. The data collected was analyzed according to age, sex, area, body mass index (BMI), and the PMQOL-SF score. The prevalence of mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) in Lebanon was found to be 5.3%. The results showed that the prevalence of MNE is inversely proportional to age. The prevalence of male to female ratio was 1.4:1. As for the prevalence according to different geographic areas, the results have shown that the North had the majority of cases with 7.6% prevalence. Results showed that 82.4% of children had a score more than 50, and only 28% of parents had a score above 50. Discussion The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis in Lebanon is lower than that in neighboring countries such as Turkey 8 and Saudi Arabia, 9 but higher than that in Italy 10 and Hong Kong. Our study has managed to show the same results, with a peak in incidence at seven years then dropping back to 0% at the age of 16. Our study has shown a male to female predominance but the male to female ratio was 1.4:1, a value lower than that described in earlier studies. Our study has shown that more than 80% of children were psychologically affected whereas only less than 30% of parents were affected. Conclusion To our knowledge, this was the first study in Lebanon conducted to determine the prevalence of MNE. The relatively low prevalence rate found may be because of differences in genetic predisposition, psychosocial or environmental conditions, and traditional and cultural backgrounds.

Especially, non-governmental organisations have used discourses of accountability to demand a say in public debates in the name of the people. This article analyses how discourses about accountability have shaped shared beliefs within and between NGOs in Namibia where the state has traditionally made strong claims to be the sole representative of national unity. Using different concepts of accountability NGO activists try to advance their position vis-à-vis colleagues, other organisations and the government. In these ongoing contestations agents use accountability sometimes in the sense of accounting and sometimes as moral answerability for one's actions.

We examined the known distribution of the natural enemies to show that most natural enemies occur over the majority of the range of the host, although the Isthmus of Panama is a barrier to many species. This indicates that few potential agents were missed. We show species accumulation curves for three sites to estimate the number of visits required to find most species at a site. Although the species accumulation curves continued to rise, even after 28 collections and 101 insects found at one site, the species utilised for biological control were found relatively early.

The development of new operative instruments, and surgical techniques, increased knowledge of liver anatomy and pathophysiology after hepatectomy, and more precise patient selection have contributed to this improvement. The use of intermittent hepatic inflow blood occlusion, a restrictive blood transfusion policy and intraoperative ultrasonography, have also led to substantial improvements in resectability and safety for HCC resection in Taiwan.

The specific objectives of the study were: to determine the water needs of riparian vegetation through the riparian growing season and throughout the SPRNCA to ensure its long-term ecological integrity; to quantify the total water use of riparian vegetation within the SPRNCA; and to determine the source of water used by key riparian plant species within the SPRNCA. To meet these objectives, the study was divided into three elements: (1) a characterization of the status and variability of hydrologic factors within the riparian system (USGS), (2) a riparian biohydrology study to relate spatial and temporal aspects of riparian changes and condition to the hydrologic variables (Arizona State University), and (3) a water-use evapotranspiration (ET) study to quantify annual consumptive ground-water use by riparian transpiration and direct evaporation from the stream channel (USDA ARS) in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the University of Wyoming, and the University of Arizona. Twenty-six sites within the SPRNCA were selected for collection of vegetation data from three primary streamflow regimes (perennial, intermittent-wet, intermittent-dry), which include the principal vegetation communities. Detailed hydrologic-condition data were collected at a subset of 16 of these sites, called the SPRNCA biohydrology sites. Water-use and water-source data were collected at a subset of 5 of the 16 biohydrology sites.

This paper proposes a new general procedure based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is applicable for all kinds of features (point, line, and areal features). However, linear features due to their unique characteristics are of interest in this investigation. This method is called Optimum number of Well-Distributed ground control Information Selection (OWDIS) procedure. Using this method, a population of binary chromosomes is randomly initialized. The ones indicate the presence of a pair of conjugate lines as a GCL and zeros specify the absence. The chromosome length is considered equal to the number of all conjugate lines. For each chromosome, the unknown parameters of a proper mathematical model can be calculated using the selected GCLs (ones in each chromosome). Then, a limited number of Check Points (CPs) are used to evaluate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of each chromosome as its fitness value. The procedure continues until reaching a stopping criterion. The number and position of ones in the best chromosome indicate the selected GCLs among all conjugate lines. To evaluate the proposed method, a GeoEye and an Ikonos Images are used over different areas of Iran. Comparing the obtained results by the proposed method in a traditional RFM with conventional methods that use all conjugate lines as GCLs shows five times the accuracy improvement (pixel level accuracy) as well as the strength of the proposed method. To prevent an over-parametrization error in a traditional RFM due to the selection of a high number of improper correlated terms, an optimized line-based RFM is also proposed.

This paper proposes a new general procedure based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is applicable for all kinds of features (point, line, and areal features). However, linear features due to their unique characteristics are of interest in this investigation. This method is called Optimum number of Well-Distributed ground control Information Selection (OWDIS) procedure. Using this method, a population of binary chromosomes is randomly initialized. The ones indicate the presence of a pair of conjugate lines as a GCL and zeros specify the absence. The chromosome length is considered equal to the number of all conjugate lines. For each chromosome, the unknown parameters of a proper mathematical model can be calculated using the selected GCLs (ones in each chromosome). Then, a limited number of Check Points (CPs) are used to evaluate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of each chromosome as its fitness value. The procedure continues until reaching a stopping criterion. The number and position of ones in the best chromosome indicate the selected GCLs among all conjugate lines. To evaluate the proposed method, a GeoEye and an Ikonos Images are used over different areas of Iran. Comparing the obtained results by the proposed method in a traditional RFM with conventional methods that use all conjugate lines as GCLs shows five times the accuracy improvement (pixel level accuracy) as well as the strength of the proposed method. To prevent an over-parametrization error in a traditional RFM due to the selection of a high number of improper correlated terms, an optimized line-based RFM is also proposed. The results show the superiority of the combination of the proposed OWDIS method with an optimized line-based RFM in terms of increasing the accuracy to better than 0.7 pixel, reliability, and reducing systematic errors.

Methods: Data from KNHANES, conducted between 2008 and 2010 by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance under the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, were used for this study. The presence of periodontal treatment needs according to demographic variables and anthropometric and hematologic characteristics of the participants are presented as means with their standard errors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations of periodontal treatment needs with the amount of alcohol intake and other variables including smoking and the number of times of toothbrushing per day. Results: An association between drinking alcohol and periodontal treatment needs could be seen in men after adjustment for variables. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in males were 1.271 (1.030 to 1.568) for heavy drinkers after controlling for age, smoking, body mass index, exercise, education, income, white blood cell count, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and number of toothbrushing episodes per day (model 3). Adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs in males were 1.569 (1.284 to 1.916) for alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) level ≥20 in model 3. ORs increased with the increase in alcohol consumption levels and AUDIT levels. Statistically significant correlations between drinking and periodontal treatment needs could not be seen in female heavy drinkers or female drinkers with AUDIT levels ≥20. Conclusions: Men with higher alcohol intake were more likely to have a higher prevalence of treatment needs regardless of their age, socioeconomic factors, systemic conditions (including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome), and number of times of toothbrushing per day in multivariable adjusted models.

Estimating the level of this impact is particularly difficult where there is high flow variability, such as dryland rivers in Australia. Such information remains critical for assessing ecological impacts to ecosystems (e.g. long-lived flood-dependent trees). To determine effects of flow reduction to a large floodplain wetland, we built statistical flow models, integrated flow and flood modelling (IFFM), for the extensive and ecologically important Lowbidgee wetland, supplied by the Murrumbidgee River, based on local annual rainfall and upstream flow data (1880–2010). Large volumes of water are diverted upstream primarily for irrigation and to Australia’s capital city, Canberra, achieved with 26 large dams: Burrinjuck Dam, Snowy Mountains Scheme dams and other upper catchment dams. We identified two periods using structural change analysis, low (before 1957) and high (after 1958) regulated periods; the year marked significant alteration in monthly flow at Redbank gauge, within the Lowbidgee wetland, after which most major dams were built. To determine differences in flow between these periods, we developed two models for three flow gauges on the lower Murrumbidgee River: Hay, Maude and Redbank. The latter two were within the floodplain wetland. The models were based on annual rainfall from stations in the upper catchment and flow, using LOESS and leave-one-out samples without overfitting. This flexible local polynomial regression method was a useful approach to modelling complex processes without theoretical models. The proposed low and high regulated models performed well using the goodness of fit (Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ⩾91.5%) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (p > 0.9999), i.e., there was no significant difference between the observed and fitted distributions of flow data at the Hay, Maude and Redbank flow gauges for both before 1957 and after 1958 periods. And these models were used to extend and predict annual low and high regulated flows from 1880 to 2010, where the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (p < 0.0001) compared low and high regulated flow data, identifying significant reductions in long-term annual median flow between low and high river regulation within the lower Murrumbidgee (47.22% for the Maude and 52.58% for the Redbank flow gauges).

Available population SRES for Portugal were downscaled to the study area using a linear approach. Local land use scenarios were produced using the following steps: (1) characterization of the present land use for each municipality of the study area using Corine Land Cover and adaptation of the CLC classes to those used in the SRES; (2) identification of recent tendencies in land use change for the study area; (3) identification of SRES tendencies for land use change in Europe; and (4) production of local scenarios of land use. Water use scenarios were derived considering both population and land use scenarios as well as scenarios of change in other parameters (technological developments, increases in efficiency, climate changes, or political and behavioural changes). The A2 scenario forecasts an increase in population (+16%) in the study area while the other scenarios show a reduction in the resident population (−6 to 8%).

A set of 21 microsatellites was used to investigate the genetic composition of 24 Creole goat breeds (910 animals) from 10 countries to estimate levels of genetic variability, infer population structure and understand genetic relationships among populations across the American continent. Three commercial transboundary breeds were included in the analyses to investigate admixture with Creole goats. Overall, the genetic diversity of Creole populations (mean number of alleles = 5.82 ± 1.14, observed heterozygosity = 0.585 ± 0.074) was moderate and slightly lower than what was detected in other studies with breeds from other regions. The Bayesian clustering analysis without prior information on source populations identified 22 breed clusters. Three groups comprised more than one population, namely from Brazil (Azul and Graúna; Moxotó and Repartida) and Argentina (Long and shorthair Chilluda, Pampeana Colorada and Angora-type goat). Substructure was found in Criolla Paraguaya. When prior information on sample origin was considered, 92% of the individuals were assigned to the source population (threshold q ≥ 0.700). Creole breeds are well-differentiated entities (mean coefficient of genetic differentiation = 0.111 ± 0.048, with the exception of isolated island populations). Dilution from admixture with commercial transboundary breeds appears to be negligible. Significant levels of inbreeding were detected (inbreeding coefficient > 0 in most Creole goat populations, P < 0.05).

Thus, increasing the efficiency in production assumes greater significance in attaining potential output at the farm level. However it is an undeniable fact that the majority of dry zone paddy farmers are characterized by poor economic status due to inefficient utilization of available resources. This paper investigates the economic and technical efficiency of paddy farming in a minor irrigation scheme in Sri Lanka and to suggest some policy recommendation for improving the efficiency of resource use.The experiment sites were four minor tanks in Tricomalee district and respective tanks were randomly selected based on the list of the village tank in same district. The empirical study was carried based on a sample of 158 farmers in selected tanks. In this study, the technical efficiency of paddy farmers was estimated by using stochastic frontier production function, incorporating technical efficiency effect model.

Furthermore, difficulties administering treatment may lead to poor adherence. New treatment strategies aim to reduce the burden associated with administration and to improve patient perception of treatment, which, in turn, increase adherence levels. Aims This study aimed to examine patient perception of HA treatment and related factors using patient‐reported outcome ( PRO ) questionnaires and to confirm the psychometric properties of a recently developed questionnaire, the Haemo PREF . Methods A non‐interventional, cross‐sectional, questionnaire study was conducted with adult HA patients in Spain (n=31), Germany (n=10) and Italy (n=48), who were using ReFacto AF with the Fuse NG o administration device.

https://openalex.org/W4251938920,2007,Environmental Science,with_mention,Seed dynamics linked to variability in movement of tidal water,"Abstract Question: Community structure may be influenced by patterns of dispersed seeds (seed rain) because they contribute to the template of plant community development. We explored factors influencing seed rain in a system dominated by tidal water, where direction and magnitude of water flow are difficult to predict, unlike many other hydrochorous systems where water flow is directional. We posed three main questions: (1) are patterns in seed rain linked to effects of hydrodynamic variability; (2) do these patterns in seed rain reflect distribution of seed sources and seed production; and (3) what are the implications for the assembly of tidal communities? Location: Salt marshes on the Wadden island of Schier‐monnikoog, The Netherlands. Methods: Species compositions of vegetation, seed rain, seed production and driftlines along a chronosequence of communities were compared. We also studied seed movement by sowing Astroturf® mats with seeds and checking for seeds remaining after a single tidal inundation. Results: Storm surges had a significant effect on seed‐rain patterns as the highest density and diversity of captured seeds were found during a stormy period. Seed rain of the youngest communities was more influenced by storms than that of older communities.

We explored factors influencing seed rain in a system dominated by tidal water, where direction and magnitude of water flow are difficult to predict, unlike many other hydrochorous systems where water flow is directional. We posed three main questions: (1) are patterns in seed rain linked to effects of hydrodynamic variability; (2) do these patterns in seed rain reflect distribution of seed sources and seed production; and (3) what are the implications for the assembly of tidal communities? Location: Salt marshes on the Wadden island of Schier‐monnikoog, The Netherlands. Methods: Species compositions of vegetation, seed rain, seed production and driftlines along a chronosequence of communities were compared. We also studied seed movement by sowing Astroturf® mats with seeds and checking for seeds remaining after a single tidal inundation. Results: Storm surges had a significant effect on seed‐rain patterns as the highest density and diversity of captured seeds were found during a stormy period. Seed rain of the youngest communities was more influenced by storms than that of older communities. Patterns in seed rain generally followed similar patterns in the distribution of established plants, and seed production. Conclusions: Results suggested mostly local dispersal of seeds. However, there was some evidence of long‐distance dispersal occurring during storm surges in younger communities that are regularly inundated with tidal water.

Using a prospective longitudinal design, this research tested whether the family environment in early childhood predicts self-esteem in later developmental periods. Data came from a nationally representative U.S. sample of 8,711 participants, who reported on their self-esteem biannually from age 8 to 27 years.

Design/methodology/approach – The study conducted a survey of 385 Libyan retail consumers. Descriptive, factor and discriminant analyses of responses were performed to identify principal factors affecting attitudes towards and the potential use of Islamic financial products and services. Findings – The results indicate that while most respondents have at least some knowledge about some Islamic products, especially Musharakah (full-equity business partnerships) and Quard Hassan (interest-free benevolent loans), they are generally unaware of many other products. Nonetheless, most respondents (85.9 per cent) are potential users of Islamic methods of finance at the retail level, though potential use varying markedly according to age, level of education, employment, income and nationality. Factor analysis reduces the large number of variables that determine retail consumers’ attitudes towards Islamic methods of finance to just community service, profitability, religion and unique services. Discriminant analysis shows that religion and community service are the most important positive attitudes determining the potential use of Islamic methods of finance by retail consumers in Libya. Research limitations/implications – The study is undertaken in a single national context, so there is no possibility of comparing the results with alternative financial systems in different stages of the adoption of Islamic finance. Research was completed in 2010, with the ongoing unrest in Libya precluding publication until recently. Practical implications – Religious motivations rank highest in determining positive attitudes to Islamic methods of finance, and marketers should ensure that Islamic financial products and services strictly comply with Sharia . However, it may be possible to strengthen these positive attitudes by promoting that the community service role of Islamic finance is also important.

Three enteroviral isolates, 2104, 3936 and 3988, were previously isolated from patients with neurological disorders or sepsis-like illness. In this study, the molecular characterization of the three isolates was investigated.&#x0D; Methodology: A full genome sequencing was performed by Sanger method, followed by phylogenetic and bootscanning analyses. A detailed analysis of genetic differences between the clinical and prototype isolates were investigated by mapping polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels, and by comparing RNA secondary structure in the noncoding regions.&#x0D; Results: Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene and complete genome, 2104 was typed as coxsackievirus B1, 3936 as coxsackievirus B5, and 3988 as echovirus 7.

Feedback to caregivers was given to improving visual functioning of these children.We grouped 321 participants, (196 (61.1%) boys, age range of 3-18 years) into 61; Down syndrome (DS), 72 with intellectual disabilities, 67; hearing impaired and 121 with other conditions. Refractive error and lag of accommodation was 26 (42.6%) and 14 (22.6%) among children with DS. Contrast sensitivity was impaired in 8 (12.7%) among hearing impaired children. Defective distant and near vision was in 162 (70%) and 104 (42%) of our cohort. Children with intellectual disability were most difficult to assess. Children in group of other disabilities"" had a higher proportion of impaired visual functioning. They were given low vision aids (telescopes (22), filters (7) and magnifiers (3)) in large numbers compared to those in other groups.The outcomes of assessment of visual functioning of children with other disabilities show great variation and difficult to group. The care therefore should be individual. All visual functions cannot be assessed at one time.",['omn']

The presence of Moho and MTZ, and associated lithologies are verified in field at Wadi Al Abyad, Wadi Nidab, Wadi Abda, Wadi Tayin, Wadi Fizh and several locations of Nakhl regions of Samail ophiolites. The laboratory study shows the occurrence of typical minerals namely olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in the harzburgite and the minerals such as plagioclase, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene and olivine in the layered gabbro. The spectral properties of the rocks are studied using Portable Infrared Mineral Analyzer (PIMA) spectrometer and the occurrences of minerals are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. This study demonstrates the sensor capability of ASTER to map Moho and MTZ, and thus it is recommended to the geoscientists and geophysicists working on Moho and MTZ. The satellite image interpretations of Moho and MTZ, and the associated rocks and minerals are consistent with the field research studies carried out in these regions. Our images have potential to map the chromites mineralized zone and dunites (refractory materials) bearing MTZ.",['omn']

Mother-infant pairs were randomly assigned to early cord clamping (within 10 s after delivery) or delayed clamping (after the cord stopped pulsating). Maternal haematological status was assessed on admission in the delivery room. Infant haematological status was evaluated in cord blood and 24 h after birth. Bilirubin concentration was assessed at 24 h. 104 mother-infant pairs were randomized to delayed (n=58) or early cord clamping (n=46). At baseline the groups had similar demographic and biomedical characteristics, except for a difference in maternal haemoglobin, which was significantly higher in the early clamping group (11.7 g/dL, SD 1.3 g/dL versus 10.9 g/dL, SD 1.6 g/dL; P=0.0035). Twenty-four hours after delivery the mean infant haemoglobin level was significantly higher in the delayed clamping group (18.5 g/dL versus 17.1 g/dL; P=0.0005). No significant differences were found in clinical jaundice or plethora. Surprisingly, blood analysis showed that two babies in the early clamping group had total serum bilirubin levels (&gt;15 mg/dL) that necessitated phototherapy.

Simpler methods are needed for intervention at all levels of care, especially in low-resource settings in rural areas. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, has been used for the management of postpartum hemorrhage although it is less effective than oxytocin. But because it has a number of advantages including ease of administration, thermostability, and relatively low cost, it can be of benefit in low resource settings. Three placebo-controlled randomized trials compared the use of misoprostol plus uterotonics and uterotonics alone in women with postpartum hemorrhage. Although a meta-analysis of these trials reported that addition of misoprostol was associated with 40% to 50% reduction in blood loss of 500 mL or more, the sample sizes were too small in these studies to make a meaningful conclusion. Moreover, a systematic review concluded that evidence for any benefit of addition of misoprostol to standard uterotonic treatment was insufficient. This multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial investigated whether adjunctive use of misoprostol in women with postpartum hemorrhage could reduce blood loss more than standard uterotonic treatment alone. The participants were 1422 women delivering vaginally who had clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. Between 2005 and 2008, all participants were enrolled from hospitals in Argentina, Egypt, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. The women were randomly assigned to receive 600 μg misoprostol (n = 705) or matching placebo (n = 717) sublingually; both groups were also given routine injectable uterotonics. Special care was taken to conceal allocation. Both providers and participants were blinded as to treatment allocation. The primary study outcome measure was blood loss of 500 mL or more within 60 minutes after. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the proportion of women with measured blood loss of 500 mL or more (misoprostol group: 100 [14%] vs. the placebo group: 100 [14%]; the relative risk was 1.02, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.79–1.32). Within 60 and 90 minutes after randomization, compared with placebo, misoprostol was associated with an increased proportion of women with shivering, body temperature of 38°C or higher, and vomiting.

Here, we report the genome sequence of this pathogen and 7,863 identified protein-coding genes, and we show that the majority of clinical isolates possess high levels of allelic diversity, genetic admixture, heterozygosity, and extensive aneuploidy. By utilizing paired genome-wide high-throughput DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) with RNA-seq, we found that gene dosage, at the level of individual genes or chromosomal “somy” (a general term covering disomy, trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.), accounted for greater than 85% of total gene expression variation in genes with a 2-fold or greater change in expression. High gene copy number variation (CNV) among membrane-bound transporters, a class of proteins previously implicated in drug resistance, was found for the most highly differentially expressed genes. Our results suggest that gene dosage is an adaptive trait that confers phenotypic plasticity among natural Leishmania populations by rapid down- or upregulation of transporter proteins to limit the effects of environmental stresses, such as drug selection. IMPORTANCE Leishmania is a genus of unicellular eukaryotic parasites that is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases that range from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) to life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Developmental and strain-specific gene expression is largely thought to be due to mRNA message stability or posttranscriptional regulatory networks for this species, whose genome is organized into polycistronic gene clusters in the absence of promoter-mediated regulation of transcription initiation of nuclear genes. Genetic hybridization has been demonstrated to yield dramatic structural genomic variation, but whether such changes in gene dosage impact gene expression has not been formally investigated. Here we show that the predominant mechanism determining transcript abundance differences (&gt;85%) in Leishmania tropica is that of gene dosage at the level of individual genes or chromosomal somy.","['irq', 'jor', 'syr']",,"['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']","['irq', 'jor', 'syr']","['irq', 'jor', 'syr']","['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']",False,"['irq', 'syr', 'jor']","['ind', 'irq', 'jor', 'syr']",,,,"Gene Expression in <i>Leishmania</i> Is Regulated Predominantly by Gene Dosage ABSTRACT Leishmania tropica , a unicellular eukaryotic parasite present in North and East Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent, has been linked to large outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis in displaced populations in Iraq, Jordan, and Syria.

The age of these sediments is of particular interest to paleontologists who have worked on important vertebrate remains in the area since the late 1970s.

In this paper we report data for calcareous nannofossils and strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis of macrofossils, which can be used to infer age of deposition of part of the Neogene section (Formation M). Because most Sahabi fossils are extensively altered by various diagenetic processes, including gypsification and dolomitization, we carefully screened tens of samples to select unaltered material for analysis. Among the many fossils collected from Formation M and analyzed by XRD, only two, Balanus sp. and a Cubitostrea digitalina show no evidence of diagenetic alteration of their shells, and thus retain their original low-Mg calcite (LMC) mineralogy.

Based on that, the study attempts to gain a comprehensive picture of the process of KT to show how physicians at two hospitals look at the knowledge of its participants and to discover how participants are willing to share, transfer and receive knowledge. Findings The results indicate that junior physicians suffered from work overload and senior ones had negative attitudes and were unwilling to share knowledge. In addition, social activities at both places were not strong enough to encourage the communication process among physicians to share insights and reduce medical errors. Originality/value The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the process of KT in two hospitals.",['omn']

This study, based on the inversion of geologically determined fault slip vectors, presents evidences for spatial and temporal changes in the stress state. Fault kinematics analyses reveal a temporal change in states of stress during the Late Cenozoic. A paleostress (Miocene–Pliocene) state is characterized by a regional compressional tectonic regime with a mean N134 ± 09°E trending horizontal maximum stress axis (σ1). A modern (Quaternary to present-day) state of stress also corresponds to compressional tectonic regime with a regionally mean N05 ± 10°E trending horizontal σ1. The SAFT corresponds to two distinct domains: a far-foreland Atlassic front related to contractional deformation associated with southward propagate thrusting, and eastward, the Gulf of Gabes characterized by normal component NW to WNW trending faults at the crustal margin scale probably related with a transtensional tectonic regime. We propose that the spatial and temporal changes in the stress during the Miocene–Pliocene and Quaternary may result from the geodynamic evolution of the Tunisian Atlas in relation to the rotation of Corsica–Sardinia blocks and the separation of the Sicilian continental lithosphere from the Ionian oceanic lithosphere.

Migrant populations usually experience a health transition with respect to their cancer risk as a result from environmental changes and acculturation processes. We investigated potentially contrasting experiences with breast and stomach cancer risk and survival in migrants to the Netherlands in a retrospective cohort study. Methods. Invasive breast (n = 96 126) and stomach cancer cases (n = 24 496) diagnosed 1996–2009 were selected from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were computed as the ratio of observed and expected cancers. Differences in survival were expressed as relative excess risk of mortality (RER). Results. Women from Morocco, Suriname and Turkey exhibited a significantly lower risk for breast cancer than native Dutch women (SIR range 0.5–0.9). Relative excess mortality was significantly increased in Surinamese (RER = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5) patients. The incidence of non-cardia stomach cancer was significantly elevated in all migrants, except in Indonesians, being highest in Turkish males (SIR = 2.2, 1.9–2.6). Cardia stomach cancer appeared to be less frequent in all migrants, being lowest in Surinamese males (SIR = 0.3, 0.2–0.5). Relative excess mortality was significantly lower in patients from the Antilles (RER = 0.7, 0.5–1.0), Suriname (0.8, 0.6–0.9) and Turkey (0.7, 0.6–0.9). Conclusion. The lower incidence rates of breast and cardia stomach cancer in migrants as well as their higher non-cardia stomach cancer rates reflect most likely early life exposures including pregnancy and/or dietary patterns during life-course.

The combination of historically barren landscape and modern impervious surfaces such as asphalt, roofs, and hard gravel was associated with decreased benthic invertebrate community diversity at all four watershed spatial scales measured. The same combination of barren bedrock and impervious surface was associated with increased levels of potentially toxic Ni, whereas increased Cu was most strongly associated with bedrock alone. Our results highlight previously undocumented relationships in this historically impacted area between unrestored landscapes, modern impervious surfaces, and their potential risks to aquatic life.

A consequence of this is that abnormal accruals may not map into realised future cash flows to the extent that would normally be expected of accruals data. Indeed, the association may be insignificant if abnormal accruals consist primarily of estimation noise. Our study investigates whether abnormal accruals for UK firms provide incremental insight into future cash flows. In particular, our paper may be viewed as a development of Subramanyam (1996). We find a significant positive association between abnormal accruals and one‐year‐ahead operating cash flows. This provides a rationale for the pricing of abnormal accruals by the market (Subramanyam, 1996; Xie, 2001) and suggests that abnormal accruals are not merely the products of noise in the accruals‐estimation process. However, our results are conditional upon the probability of one‐year‐ahead bankruptcy risk (Charitou et al., 2004).

First results are shown of a project aiming to estimate daily values of reference crop evapotranspiration ET0 from geo-stationary satellite imagery. In particular, for Woreta, a site in the Ethiopian highland at an elevation of about 1800 m, we tested a radiation-temperature based approximate formula proposed by Makkink (MAK) adopting ET0 evaluated with the version of the Penman-Monteith equation described in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56 as the most accurate estimate. More precisely we used the latter with measured daily solar radiation as input (denoted by PMFAO-Rs). Our data set for Woreta concerns a period where the surface was fully covered with short green non-stressed vegetation. Our project was carried out in the context of the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LANDSAF) facility. Among others, the scope of LANDSAF is to increase benefit from the EUMETSAT Satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In this study we applied daily values of downward solar radiation at the surface obtained from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) radiometer. In addition, air temperature at 2 m was obtained from 3-hourly forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Both MAK and PMFAO-Rs contain the psychrometric ""constant"", which is proportional to air pressure, which, in turn, decreases with elevation. In order to test elevation effects we tested MAK and its LANDSAF input data for 2 sites in the Jordan Valley located about 250 m b.s.l. Except for a small underestimation of air temperature at the Ethiopian site at 1800 m, the first results of our LANDSAF-ET0 project are promising. If our approach to derive ET0 proves successfully, then the LANDSAF will be able to initiate nearly real time free distribution of ET0 for the full MSG disk.","['jor', 'eth']","['eth', 'jor']","['eth', 'jor']","['jor', 'eth']","['eth', 'jor']","['eth', 'jor']",True,"['eth', 'jor']",,,,,"Reference crop evapotranspiration derived from geo-stationary satellite imagery – a case study for the Fogera flood plain, NW-Ethiopia and the Jordan Valley, Jordan Abstract.

Hormonal seric values were correlated with sperm count, motility, and antisperm antibody as detected by Latex Agglutination Test . No clinical importance of autoantibody was appeared in all groups of subjects investigated. A significant week correlation was found between serum LH and sperm count in all infertile males (p=0.002) but not motility, whereas PRL and FSH showed an inverse relationship with motility (r = -0.469 p<0.005, r = -0.316 p< 0.005) respectively. The mean PRL level (reference range 2.5-17 ng/ml) was found to be higher in sever oligospermia and azoospermia (mean 17.9 ±12.7 and 18.6 ±11.7 respectively). On the other hand, the mean LH levels (reference range 0.8-7.6 mIU/ml) and FSH (reference range 0.7-11.1 mIU/ml) was found to be higher in azoospermia (19.9±14.9 and 24.8±32.4 respectively).

In this study we used MaxEnt for niche modelling in predicting carob (&lt;em&gt;Ceratonia siliqua &lt;/em&gt;L.) trees spatial distribution in the Province of Azilal in Morocco. The results obtained show that a large area of the mountain regions is suitable for the expansion of &lt;em&gt;Ceratonia siliqua&lt;/em&gt; stands. These findings will help decision makers in forest planning to better identify suitable sites for carob tree plantations and assess the potential of the exiting populations.",['mar']

An organic coating, i.e., ACE Premium Enamel, on a metallic alloy, i.e., a carbon steel, was investigated at a temperature range simulating the severe weather temperatures in Kuwait, especially between the daylight and the nighttime temperatures, 20–60 °C. The investigation focused on determining the in-plane displacement of the coating, which amounts to the thermal deformation (strain) with respect to the applied temperature range. Furthermore, the investigation focused on determining the thermal expansion coefficients of coatings, the slope of the plot of the thermal deformation (strain) versus the applied temperature range. In other words, one could determine, from the decreasing value of the thermal expansion coefficients of coatings, a critical (steady state) value of the thermal expansion coefficients of coatings, in which the integrity of the coatings can be assessed with respect to time. In fact, determination of the critical (steady state) value of the thermal expansion coefficients of coatings could be accomplished independent of parameters, i.e., ultraviolet (UV) exposure, humidity, and exposure to chemical species, which normally are considered in conventional methods of assessing the integrity of coatings.

These difficulties are intrinsic to the dating of ancient divergence events and are reflected in the large discrepancies between estimates obtained with different approaches. Estimates of the age of Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) vary approximately twofold, from ~1,100 million years ago (Mya) to ~2,300 Mya. Results We applied the genome-wide analysis of rare genomic changes associated with conserved amino acids (RGC_CAs) and used several independent techniques to obtain date estimates for the divergence of the major lineages of eukaryotes with calibration intervals for insects, land plants and vertebrates. The results suggest an early divergence of monocot and dicot plants, approximately 340 Mya, raising the possibility of plant-insect coevolution. The divergence of bilaterian animal phyla is estimated at ~400-700 Mya, a range of dates that is consistent with cladogenesis immediately preceding the Cambrian explosion. The origin of opisthokonts (the supergroup of eukaryotes that includes metazoa and fungi) is estimated at ~700-1,000 Mya, and the age of LECA at ~1,000-1,300 Mya. We separately analyzed the red algal calibration interval which is based on single fossil. This analysis produced time estimates that were systematically older compared to the other estimates. Nevertheless, the majority of the estimates for the age of the LECA using the red algal data fell within the 1,200-1,400 Mya interval. Conclusion The inference of a ""young LECA"" is compatible with the latest of previously estimated dates and has substantial biological implications. If these estimates are valid, the approximately 1 to 1.4 billion years of evolution of eukaryotes that is open to comparative-genomic study probably was preceded by hundreds of millions years of evolution that might have included extinct diversity inaccessible to comparative approaches.

The 2000's were marked by a boom in education with the opening of twelve private universities in this country of roughly 1 million inhabitants. Some institutions were locally based, while others worked in affiliation with foreign based universities. It is in sharp contrast with the 1990's, when only three public universities served as centers of higher education. The reasons behind this large-scale expansion of higher education include the growth of local and expatriate population, the planned transition from oil industry to a knowledge-based economy as well as the growing role of women in the workforce. All of these factors need to be addressed in order to assure a stable social and economic development, and education is the backbone of both.

After removal of the wind-driven components from the drifter velocities and low-pass filtering in bins of 1° × 1° × 1 week, maps of surface geostrophic circulation (mean flow and kinetic energy levels) are produced using the drifter and/or satellite data. The mean currents and kinetic energy levels derived from the drifter data appear stronger/higher with respect to those obtained from satellite altimeter data. The maps of mean circulation estimated from the drifter data and from a combination of drifter and altimeter data are, however, qualitatively similar. In the western basin they show the main pathways of the surface waters flowing eastward from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Sicily Channel and the current transporting waters back westward along the Italian, French, and Spanish coasts. Intermittent and long-lived subbasin-scale eddies and gyres abound in the Tyrrhenian and Algerian Seas. In the eastern basin, the surface waters are transported eastward by several currents but recirculate in numerous eddies and gyres before reaching the northward coastal current off Israel, Lebanon, and Syria and veering westward off Turkey. In the Ionian Sea, the mean geostrophic velocity maps were also produced separately for the two extended seasons and for multiyear periods. Significant variations are confirmed, with seasonal reversals of the currents in the south and changes of the circulation from anticyclonic (prior to 1 July 2007) to cyclonic and back to anticyclonic after 31 December 2005.",,,"['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']","['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']","['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']","['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']",True,"['lbn', 'tur', 'syr', 'isr', 'gib']",,,"['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']","['isr', 'lbn', 'syr', 'tur']","Surface Geostrophic Circulation of the Mediterranean Sea Derived from Drifter and Satellite Altimeter Data Abstract Drifter observations and satellite-derived sea surface height data are used to quantitatively study the surface geostrophic circulation of the entire Mediterranean Sea for the period spanning 1992–2010.
